# Testing

This is a personal project with one developer and no users to page at 3am. Tests here are
not a quality ritual and not a coverage target — they are a **tripwire**. Their job is to
notice when something quietly stops working: a refactor that drops a `userId` from a
`where` clause, a date helper that shifts by an hour across DST, an agent that "fixes" a
bug by deleting the guard that caught it.

That purpose sets the bar. A test earns its place if it would **fail loudly on a plausible
mistake**. If breaking the code would not break the test, the test is decoration.

## What gets tested

**Pure logic in `src/lib/**` — always.** Recurrence expansion, sort keys, tree slicing,
date geometry, filters. These are cheap to test, hold the trickiest reasoning in the
codebase, and are exactly where a wrong answer looks plausible. Adjacent `foo.test.ts`.

**Database mutations and queries — always, as `*.integration.test.ts`.** Every one of these
takes a `userId` and is expected to scope by it. Prove it: a mutation suite is not done
until it has a case where **a second user tries to read, change, and delete the first
user's row and fails at every step**. A dropped `userId` is one of the easiest mistakes to
make and is completely invisible when you only ever test with one user.

**React components — no.** There is no testing-library setup and adding one is not
currently worth it. The bug class that actually bit this codebase in components was
unhandled promise rejections, and that is caught by the type-aware ESLint rules
(`no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`) far more cheaply than by rendering tests.
If a component grows real logic, extract it to `src/lib/**` and test it there.

**Server actions in `src/app/**/actions.ts` — no.** They are thin wrappers that resolve
the user and delegate. Test what they delegate to.

## What a good test looks like here

- **Name the invariant, not the mechanics.** `"does not let one user rename another's
chart"` survives a rewrite. `"calls db.update with the right args"` does not.
- **Pin behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong**, and say why in a comment when the
  expected value is non-obvious — DST boundaries, end-of-month clamping, inclusive vs
  exclusive range ends, "end after N occurrences" when the window starts later.
- **Prefer real values over mocks.** Integration tests use the real Postgres from
  `npm run db:up`, each under a freshly created user, cleaned up in `afterAll`. Do not mock
  Drizzle — a mocked query proves nothing about the query.
- **Cover the boundary, not every value.** One test for "interval 0 floors to 1" beats six
  tests for intervals 1 through 6.

## What not to write

- Snapshot tests. They pass whatever the code does, which is the opposite of a tripwire.
- Tests that restate the implementation line by line. When the code changes they change
  with it and never catch anything.
- Tests for framework or library behaviour. Drizzle and Vitest are already tested.
- Tests for trivial pass-throughs, getters, or type-only modules.

## When adding a feature

1. Put the real logic in `src/lib/**`, not in the component.
2. Write the pure tests alongside it. If the logic branches on dates, include a DST or
   month-boundary case. Calendar fixtures use **`fromDateKey("2026-08-01")`** and assert
   with **`toDateKey`** — never `new Date("2026-08-01")`, never `getHours() === 0` (stored
   as UTC noon). Keep the Aug 1→Jul 31 regression covered — see `development/dates.md`.
3. If it touches the database, add an `*.integration.test.ts` — including the cross-user
   case.
4. Run `npm test`. The pre-commit hook runs the unit tests and pre-push runs everything,
   but do not make the hook the first time you find out.

## Mechanics

|                        |                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit tests             | `foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`, no database, must stay hermetic    |
| Integration tests      | `foo.integration.test.ts`, real Postgres, one fresh user per test |
| Run everything         | `npm test`                                                        |
| Run only the fast ones | `npm run test:unit`                                               |

Integration tests **skip loudly** when Postgres is unreachable, so a stopped container
never blocks a commit — see `src/lib/testing/database.ts`. That means a green
`npm run test:unit` does **not** mean the database logic passed. Check for the skip
warning before trusting a green run on a change that touched `src/lib/**/mutations.ts` or
`queries.ts`.

## development/clean-code

# Clean code

Most of the code here is written by an agent and reviewed by one person in a hurry. That
changes what "clean" is for. It is not craftsmanship for its own sake — refactoring is
cheap now, so the old argument from cost is weaker. What is expensive is **review** and
**being wrong in a plausible-looking way**.

So the principles that survive are the ones that make code (a) easy to skim and trust in a
diff, and (b) safe for an agent to change one part of without breaking a distant part.
Names, small units, hard boundaries, boring consistency, and testability. Everything below
is one of those five wearing a different hat.

## The layers, and which way dependencies point

This is the highest-value rule in the file. It is what lets an agent work inside
`src/lib/fitness/` without touching the schedule.

```
src/app/**          routes, pages, and actions.ts — thin
  ↓
src/components/**   presentation and interaction
  ↓
src/lib/<domain>/   the real logic: pure modules, queries.ts, mutations.ts, types.ts
  ↓
src/db/             Drizzle schema and the client
```

Concretely:

- **`src/lib/**` never imports from `src/app/**`.** It does not know it is in a web app.
  It imports `@/components` only for a shared _type_ (a column shape), never a component.
- **Components never touch the database.** They may `import type` from `@/db/schema` and
  from a `mutations.ts` (a patch type is part of the contract), but the `db` client itself
  stops at `src/lib`. Components mutate by calling a server action.
- **`actions.ts` is a wrapper, not a place for logic.** It resolves the user, delegates to
  `src/lib`, revalidates, and shapes the result. `src/app/fitness/actions.ts` is the
  reference: one `run()` helper, one line per action. If an action grows a branch, the
  branch belongs in `src/lib`.
- **Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and scopes on it.** No exceptions,
  no ambient current-user lookup inside `src/lib`. See `development/testing.md` for why
  this is also a testing rule.

When a change wants to cross a layer the wrong way, that is the signal to stop and move
logic down, not to add an import.

## Names

Name the concept, not the mechanics. The file names in `src/lib/tree/` are the standard to
hold: `completionCascade.ts`, `shelving.ts`, `owningProject.ts`, `nextActions.ts`. Each one
tells you what domain question it answers before you open it.

- A module is named for the idea it owns, and its test is `<same>.test.ts` beside it.
- Functions read as what they return or do — `matchesFilter`, `flattenLevels`,
  `requireExercise`. `handle`, `process`, `doUpdate` are not names.
- Booleans read as assertions: `isShelved`, `hasChildren`.
- Say the unit when there is one: `weightLb`, `delaySeconds`, `dateKey` — never a bare
  `date` for something that is actually a calendar day string. See `development/dates.md`.
- Match the surrounding spelling, including the British `normalise`/`normaliseEquipment`
  already in `src/lib/fitness/`. Consistency beats your preference.

Good names are also the cheapest prompt engineering available: an agent continues the
patterns it can see, and ambiguous names are what make it invent a second, conflicting one.

## Small units, one reason to change

Pure logic goes in `src/lib/<domain>/` as a small module with a single job, and gets a
sibling test. `src/lib/fitness/` shows the grain: `plates.ts`, `bars.ts`, `restTimer.ts`,
`weightStep.ts` — each a concept, each a few dozen lines, each testable without a database
or a render.

- If a component holds a calculation, a comparison, or a rule with an edge case, that
  belongs in `src/lib`. The component keeps the wiring.
- If a function needs a comment to explain its second half, that half is a function.
- Split by _reason to change_, not by size. `queries.ts` and `mutations.ts` stay separate
  even when both are long, because they change for different reasons.

## Consistency over cleverness

There is one of each thing here. Use it; do not build a second one.

| Concern              | The one implementation                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tabular anything     | `DataGrid` (`src/components/grid/`) — see `components/data-grid.md`         |
| Centered dialog      | `ModalShell` (`src/components/detail/`) — see `components/modal-pattern.md` |
| Record editing       | `Drawer` + `DrawerFooter` — see `components/drawer-pattern.md`              |
| Views and commands   | the registries in `src/components/shell/` — see `components/navigation.md`  |
| Server action result | `run()` / `runQuery()` / `ActionResult` in `src/app/actionResult.ts`        |
| HTTP responses       | `{ ok, data }` / `{ ok, error }` — see `api/response-format.md`             |
| Calendar dates       | `fromDateKey` / `toDateKey` — see `development/dates.md`                    |

A second grid or a bespoke dialog is not a local decision; it is a permanent tax on every
future change and a fork in the pattern an agent will learn from. If the shared component
genuinely cannot do the job, extend the shared component.

The same holds inside a file: copy the error-handling, the import order, and the argument
order of the code next to it, even where you would have chosen differently on a blank page.

## Explicit over implicit; simple over general

- Make data flow visible. Prefer a passed argument to a context lookup, a returned value to
  a mutated parameter, one `if` to a lookup table of one entry.
- **No speculative generality.** Do not add an options object, a strategy parameter, or a
  `<T>` for a second caller that does not exist. When the second caller arrives, generalise
  then — the diff is small and the shape will be right, which it would not have been.
- Comments explain _why_, and are worth writing exactly where the reasoning is non-obvious:
  the header comment in `src/lib/fitness/mutations.ts` ("history rows never cascade from the
  outline") is the model. Comments that restate the code are noise that goes stale.
- Where a rule is deliberately not enforced, say so and say why — the
  `no-unnecessary-condition` note in `eslint.config.mjs` is the model. A future agent will
  otherwise "fix" it.

## Testability

Design so the tricky part can be tested without a browser: pure function in, value out.
That is the practical reason logic lives in `src/lib`. What to test and what to skip is
`development/testing.md` — do not duplicate it here.

## DRY, judiciously

Deduplicate a **business rule** — a rule that must change in one place or be wrong. Priority
ordering, shelving semantics, date encoding: one implementation, always.

Tolerate duplicate _shape_. Two components with similar JSX, two queries with a similar
`where`, are not a violation. Extracting them early produces an abstraction with a boolean
parameter, which is worse than the copy and harder to unpick later. Two occurrences is a
coincidence; three with the same reason to change is a pattern.

## When an agent writes it

- **Small, reviewable diffs.** A change that touches one domain folder gets read properly;
  a 40-file change gets skimmed and merged on faith.
- **Review agent output like a junior's:** run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and the
  typecheck, and read the diff. Confident, plausible, and wrong is the failure mode.
- **New abstractions, new dependencies, and new shared components need a reason stated in
  the PR or the spec.** Deleting a guard, a check, or a test to make something pass needs a
  louder one.
- **Load the relevant standards before writing** (`/inject-standards`). Stated constraints
  are what keep generated code inside the guardrails.
- Put human effort into the expensive parts — layer boundaries, the data model, the
  `userId` scoping, domain rules — and let the agent do the mechanical work inside them.

## development/security

# Security

This file exists because real bank data landed in the app on 2026-08-12. The application
layer already scoped every finance read and write by `userId`; what it did not have was a
written rule for the next agent that touches auth, a mutation, or a header. The
hardening that prompted this file is
`agent-os/specs/2026-08-12-1316-security-hardening-and-standard/`.

## Per-user scoping is the core invariant

Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and **proves ownership before
writing**. An `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?` that matches nothing looks exactly
like a successful no-op, so a dropped `userId` is invisible unless something checks.
`requireTransaction` / `requireAccount` in `src/lib/finances/mutations.ts` are the
pattern: load the row scoped to the caller, throw if it is missing, then write.

A database test is not done until a second user has tried to read, change, and delete
the first user's row and failed at every step. That is also in
`development/testing.md`; it is restated here because it is a security rule that happens
to be enforced by tests, not a testing preference.

When you add a query module, register it in
`src/lib/db/crossUserReads.integration.test.ts`. That file is the repo-wide sweep for a
dropped `userId`. A new `listX` that only ever runs in a one-user test will not catch
itself.

## The auth gate is server-side; the proxy is not the gate

`src/proxy.ts` checks cookie _presence_ so guests never see the app chrome. The
authority is `getCurrentUserId()` inside each page and action, which validates the
session. That redundancy is the point. Next's middleware-bypass CVE class
(CVE-2025-29927) was a non-event here because a request that skipped the proxy still
had no session and no user.

Do not "simplify" this by making the proxy the only check. Do not narrow the matcher
to skip prefetches: that matcher is the auth gate as well as the header pass.

## Three identities stay separate

From `src/lib/auth/identity.ts`:

1. **Session user** — a human at `/login`.
2. **Dev user** — who the local bypass serves. Default `test@example.com`. Never an
   owner account by default.
3. **Agent user** — who a valid `PLANNER_AGENT_API_KEY` maps to. Required in
   production; no fallback to a real account.

These were one function until the local bypass started running as the account linked to
a real Google Calendar. Unconfigured defaults must resolve to a test address or throw,
never to real data. The two independent gates on the bypass itself are in
`src/lib/auth/dev-bypass.ts` — it is inert in a production build even if the env var
is set.

## Secrets

- Environment only. `.env*` is gitignored except `.env.example`.
- Fail closed when a required secret is unset. The agent Bearer key is the model:
  missing key → `internal`, not open access. See `api/agent-auth.md`.
- Timing-safe comparison for any shared secret, and hash first so length does not leak.
- Never log an `Authorization` header or a password.

## Errors: messages we wrote are user-facing; messages the database wrote are not

Deliberate throws (`new Error("Transaction not found.")`) are the inline validation the
drawers render. Driver errors are not. `postgres` quotes table, column, and constraint
names, and a constraint violation can quote the offending **row values** — which for
the finance tables is a bank description and an amount. Connection failures embed the
database host.

The tell is a `code` property, or `name === "PostgresError"`. Nothing this codebase
throws on purpose has a `code`. The check lives in `src/lib/security/safeError.ts` and
runs at every client boundary: `actionErrorMessage` in `src/app/actionResult.ts`, and
the import/export route catches. Log the real error before replacing it, or the next
Neon timeout becomes "Something went wrong." with no way to find out why.

Do not start a `UserFacingError` hierarchy to "do this properly." One hundred and fifty
deliberate sentences would have to be reclassified, and a missed one would become
"Something went wrong." The leak class that matters is the one nobody wrote.

## Headers and CSP

Static headers live in `next.config.ts`: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`. The Content-Security-Policy is **not** there —
it carries a per-request nonce, generated in `src/proxy.ts` and built by
`src/lib/security/csp.ts`.

The nonce must be set on the **request** and the **response**. Next.js extracts it by
parsing the CSP off the request, which is how framework and bundle script tags get it
without a single `<script>` being touched. Setting it only on the response ships a
policy whose nonce nothing on the page carries — a blank screen, not a soft failure.

Two constraints that will look like mistakes:

- **No nonce in `style-src`.** A nonce present in a directive makes the browser ignore
  `'unsafe-inline'` in that same directive. FullCalendar positions every event with an
  inline `style` attribute; a nonce here breaks the calendar while looking stricter.
- **`'unsafe-eval'` is development only.** React uses `eval` to rebuild server stacks
  in the browser. Neither React nor Next.js evals in a production build.
  `upgrade-insecure-requests` is production only for the same reason:
  `http://localhost:3047` must keep working.

**Do not set HSTS.** Vercel already sends
`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` on `.vercel.app`, and that domain is on
the browser preload list. A hand-rolled value would risk overriding a
preload-qualified one with a weaker one.

## Rate limiting

Better Auth's in-memory sign-in limit (3 per 10s) is adequate against a 36-character
password from a manager, with public sign-up disabled. Database-backed storage would
buy DoS/cost control at the price of a table and a write per auth request on Neon's
free tier.

Revisit when any of these become true: a second human user, public sign-up, or a
password that is not from a manager.

`minPasswordLength` is 16 in both `src/lib/auth/server.ts` and
`src/lib/auth/provision.ts`. The provision copy exists because a script that hashed a
short password would write a row Better Auth then refused to sign in.

## Dependencies

Patch `next` promptly — it is the runtime surface. Dev-only transitives
(`drizzle-kit`, `esbuild`, unused `sharp` via `next/image`) are low priority.
Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens the PRs weekly, grouped by
production/development minor+patch. Majors stay ungrouped so they get read.

## Markdown

`rehype-raw` stays out of `react-markdown`. Notes are a stored-XSS surface if HTML in
a note becomes executable. See `src/components/notes/MarkdownPreviewBody.tsx`.

---

## development/commits

# Commits

Agents commit and push here at their own discretion — `CLAUDE.md` says so, and that is not
going to change. So there is no reviewer standing between a bad commit and `master`. What
that removes is the safety net; what it does not remove is the reader. The reader is a
future agent running `git log -S` or `git blame` on a line it is about to change, six
months from now, with none of today's context and no way to ask.

That is the whole job of a commit here: **leave the next agent enough to change this line
safely.** Everything below follows from it.

The division of labour with `agent-os/specs/` is: a spec says what we meant to build and
why we wanted it. A commit says what this diff does to the code and why _this_ shape. They
answer different questions, and `git blame` only reaches one of them.

Use them in that order and only as far as the work needs:

- For established behavior, read the governing spec's decisions and acceptance criteria,
  following only deltas that affect the same concern.
- Read commits when implementation history matters — a regression, a non-obvious line, an
  earlier rejected approach, or verification that cannot be inferred from the tree. Start
  with `git log -- <paths>`, then inspect the few matching commits or blame lines.
- If a spec, the code, and history disagree, report it. A commit explains a change; it does
  not create a requirement or silently supersede a spec.

## One logical change per commit

This is the rule that pays for all the others, and the one agents break by default. An
agent can produce a forty-file diff in a minute, and a forty-file diff can only ever get a
vague message, because there is no single thing to say about it.

- A commit is one thing that could be reverted on its own. If the subject needs an "and",
  that is usually two commits.
- Mechanical churn — a rename, a move, a formatting pass — goes in its own commit, apart
  from behaviour change. `Move the filter rules and item-kind config down into src/lib` is
  a move; the deduplication it enabled is described in its body because it happened in the
  same motion, but a behaviour change would not have ridden along.
- Large commits are legitimate when the change genuinely is one thing — replacing the
  command row touched 57 files because a half-replaced command row does not run. That is
  the exception that needs the body to carry it, not the default.

Small commits are also cheap insurance against the failure mode in `clean-code.md`:
confident, plausible, and wrong. A wrong commit that touched one domain folder is a
one-line revert.

## Subject line

Imperative mood, capitalised, no trailing period, **72 characters hard maximum** and
aim for 50–60. The log averages 51 and has crossed 72 five times in 305 commits; hold that.

Write the **effect on the product or the code**, not the files touched and not the
activity. Complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will…".

| Instead of              | Write                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Refactor actions.ts`   | `Give every server action one run() instead of eleven copies`         |
| `Fix date bug`          | `Refuse a date that does not exist instead of rolling it over`        |
| `Update grid selection` | `Select the rows the grid is showing, not the ones handed to it`      |
| `Improve fitness UI`    | `Give Fitness one create button instead of two identical plus glyphs` |

The pattern in the good column is doing real work: naming both the new behaviour and the
old one in the same breath tells a reader scanning `git log --oneline` whether this is the
commit they are hunting for, without opening it. Use it whenever a change replaces
something.

Deliberately **not** Conventional Commits — no `feat:` / `fix(scope):` prefix. Nothing in
this repo consumes them: no changelog generation, no semantic versioning, no release
tooling, and one developer. They would spend ten to fourteen characters of a 72-character
budget on a label that no tool reads and that `git log --oneline` already conveys better in
prose. This is a decision, not an oversight — do not "fix" it, and do not start half a
second era in the log.

## Body

Wrap at 72 characters. Explain **why**, and what the diff cannot say for itself. The diff
already shows how.

A body is **required** when any of these is true:

- The change is not obviously correct from the diff — a subtle condition, an ordering
  dependency, a boundary case.
- Something was deliberately left alone, or deliberately not generalised. Say which and
  why, or the next agent will "finish the job" and break something.
- An alternative was considered and rejected.
- The change touches a layer boundary, a `userId` scope, the date encoding, or any other
  invariant named in the standards.
- It is a bug fix: say what the old behaviour was. A subject like "Refuse a date that does
  not exist instead of rolling it over" is only half the story without "February 30th
  silently became March 2nd on import".

A subject alone is fine for the genuinely self-evident: a typo, a log entry, a doc tweak,
a version bump. About a fifth of the log has no body and that is the right proportion.

Things worth putting in a body that are easy to forget:

- **What you verified.** "Verified end to end in a browser", "added the cross-user
  isolation case", "the integration tests ran against real Postgres" — this matters more
  here than in a reviewed repo, because it is the only signal that the gate in
  `development/testing.md` was actually met and not skipped past a `SKIP` warning.
- **What was left for later**, if the change is knowingly partial.
- **A number, when it makes the point**: "274 lines deleted, 86 added" says more about a
  deduplication than a paragraph.

## Trailers

Use this exact trailer when the work implements a shaped spec:

```
Spec: agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-feature-slug
```

No trailing slash and no bare folder name. Cite the current implementing spec or delta,
not its whole predecessor chain; the delta owns those relationships. Repeat `Spec:` only
when one logical change is genuinely governed by more than one spec. Unshaped maintenance
does not need a trailer. This is the link from a blamed line back to intent.

**No AI attribution.** No `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with", no tool names — this is
already a hard rule in `CLAUDE.md`, and the reason it makes sense here rather than being
mere preference is that almost every commit in this repo is agent-written. A marker present
on everything distinguishes nothing; it would only add four lines of noise to 305 commits
and counting. The transparency argument for attribution assumes a reader deciding which
changes to scrutinise harder. Here, the answer is all of them.

## The one part of this that is enforced

`.husky/commit-msg` rejects three things because they cannot be repaired after push:

- **A subject over 72 characters.** The hard maximum above.
- **A body line over 120 characters.** Not the 72-column wrap — that is a preference the log
  breaks 637 times in 200 commits and is none of a hook's business. 120 catches a different
  failure: an entire body arriving as **one line**, which is what happens when the blank line
  between paragraphs is written as a literal `\n` inside `-m "…"` by a shell that does not
  interpret it. Seven commits in two days landed that way, one of them a single
  583-character line. Use a heredoc or repeated `-m` flags.
- **A malformed or nonexistent `Spec:` path when the trailer is present.** The hook accepts
  only the canonical form above and checks that its directory exists. It does not require
  every commit to cite a spec.

The two length thresholds were measured against the existing log; the trailer check is
forward-only, and older spelling variants remain in immutable history. `--no-verify` skips
the hook for a message that genuinely needs an exception.

## Before committing

- Run the gates from `clean-code.md` — `npm test`, `npm run lint`, the typecheck — and read
  the diff. A commit that does not build is worse than no commit; `git bisect` has to step
  over it forever.
- Check `git status` for files that wandered in. Staging everything is how a debug script
  or a stray `.env` ends up in the permanent record.
- Push to `origin/master` when the working tree is green. Long-lived local work is a
  liability nobody is reviewing anyway.
- Never rewrite published history. A confusing message that is already pushed gets a
  clarifying follow-up commit, not a rebase.

## components/ux-principles

# UI/UX Design Principles

The design philosophy behind our component patterns. Read this before the
implementation-focused standards (`drawer-pattern.md`) — it explains _why_ those patterns
exist.

Adapted from the same standard in Lee's `wrcs/reactwrcs` project, where these principles
emerged from iterating through grid → tabs → modals → grid+drawer during 2025–2026. They
align with patterns used in Linear, Supabase, Retool, and other modern tools. Where this
document differs from the original, it is because Achieve Planner's model differs — see
**Tabs** below.

## Core Principles

- **Context preservation** — never hide the outline unless absolutely necessary. It is the
  user's map of everything they have committed to; losing sight of it is disorienting.
- **Consistency** — the same patterns across every view, and aligned with conventions users
  already know from elsewhere.
- **Clarity over cleverness** — if users have to guess how to do something, the design has
  already failed.
- **Error prevention > error recovery** — make dangerous or irreversible actions hard to do
  by accident.
- **Progressive disclosure** — show only what's needed now; hide complexity until relevant.
- **Immediate, clear feedback** for every action.
- **Keyboard first on desktop, touch-complete on phone** — this app replaces a keyboard-driven
  Windows tool. At `md` and above, anything reachable by mouse should be reachable by key, and
  the primary workflows should be faster by keyboard than by mouse. Below `md` that inverts:
  every action must have a visible, tappable path, because there is no keyboard, no hover and
  no right button. Neither half is optional — a shortcut with no button fails on the phone, and
  a button with no shortcut fails at the desk. See `responsive.md`.
- **Accessibility is not a goal here** — one user, no screen reader, not public. Skip ARIA
  coverage, contrast ratios and screen-reader testing; add them if this is ever released.
  Keep the handful of roles and labels that are load-bearing for other reasons (see
  `modal-pattern.md`) — they are wiring, not compliance.
  **Hit-target size and touch-reachability are not covered by this exemption.** A 44px tap
  target and a tappable path to every command are usability for the one user we have, on the
  phone he actually owns — not compliance for a hypothetical audience.
- **Performance is UX** — slow expand/collapse or heavy re-renders destroy usability in a
  dense grid.
- **Forgiveness & safety** — let users recover easily; never force inaccurate data entry.

## Layout & Navigation

### Getting between views, and finding commands

A collapsible **sidebar** for where you can go; a **menu bar** (File leftmost) as the
complete catalog of what you can do; an **icon row** for the handful of commands used most
sessions; a pinnable **Commands panel** as that same tree left open; a `⌘K` **palette** as
the searchable overlay (plus Go-to). Below `md`, **`⋯` is the menu bar**. Views and
commands each live in exactly one registry. Full rules, including why a command without a
menu row is not shipped: **`navigation.md`**.

### Grid + drawer is the default

The **outline grid + right-sliding drawer** is the standard pattern for list + form work
(see `drawer-pattern.md`):

- **Grid** for scanning, filtering, reordering, and fast inline edits
- **Drawer** for the full record — the grid stays visible, preserving context

Below `md` this becomes **list + full-screen sheet**. Context preservation is the principle the
drawer serves, and on a 390px screen it is unaffordable — there is no room to keep the grid
visible and still show a form worth filling in. The compact layout gives up that principle
knowingly, in the one place where the alternative is worse. Everything else on this page still
applies. See `responsive.md`.

### Inline editing for grid-visible fields

Fields that appear as grid columns — name, priority, effort, deadline, state, focus — are
edited **in place**. Opening a drawer to change a priority would be absurd. The drawer is
for the fields that don't fit on a row.

Where a value is a rollup of its descendants (a parent's effort), the cell is **read-only**.
Never offer an editor whose result would be invisible behind a computed value.

### Sorted grids: do not move the world while the user is still typing

**Context preservation applies inside a grid row too.** If the user is mid-edit, the row
must stay put. Re-sorting (or re-filtering) the moment a sort-key column changes under the
cursor is classic poor UX: they lose their place, can't finish the value, and the interface
feels hostile.

Rules:

1. **Commit on finish, not on every intermediate change.**  
   Buffer the editor in local state. Write to the model on **blur**, **Enter**, or an
   explicit Accept — not on each keystroke and not on each partial date-picker step.
2. **Defer re-sort until the edit session ends.**  
   While any cell in the sorted grid (or tracking table) has focus, freeze the on-screen
   row order. After focus leaves the grid, re-apply sort. Optional later polish: animate
   the row to its new place or offer a manual “Re-sort” control; never jump mid-edit.
3. **Date pickers: month/year navigation is not a commit.**  
   Changing month or year is exploratory. Only a complete day selection, Accept, or blur
   of a finished value should update storage. With native `type="date"`, treat `onChange`
   as draft-only and commit on blur — do not fire a server write that reloads and re-sorts
   the list while the calendar is still open.
4. **Same for other multi-step editors** (decimal fields, composite values): draft locally,
   commit when the user is done (see Metric tracking value/date cells).

| Action while editing a sorted column | Good                                    | Bad                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Open date picker / change month      | Calendar navigates; no write; row stays | Picker closes, value saves, row jumps |
| Key into a value cell                | Local draft only                        | Every keystroke re-sorts              |
| Blur / Enter after a real change     | Commit, then re-sort when focus leaves  | Already sorted three steps ago        |

This is the same principle as the drawer: **do not hide or rearrange the user's map while
they are working on a piece of it.**

### Avoid modals for routine editing

Modals hide context, increase cognitive load, and feel interruptive. Reserve them for:

- **Destructive confirmations** — "Delete this project and everything under it?"
- **Critical blocking actions** where the user _must_ decide before continuing
- **Fast capture** — a transient, keyboard-invoked surface that owns no record

Never use a modal for a standard create/edit flow.

#### The capture exception

Quick capture (`QuickCaptureDialog`) is a modal on what looks like a create flow, and is
still right. The discriminator is **whether context preservation is wanted**:

|                      | Standard create/edit | Fast capture            |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose              | Full record editing  | Get it out of your head |
| Context preservation | High                 | **Low, intentionally**  |
| Bound to a record    | Yes                  | No — nothing exists yet |
| Bulk / freeform text | No                   | Yes                     |
| Pattern              | Drawer               | Modal                   |

The rule protects your view of the outline while you work _on_ something in it. During
capture the outline is irrelevant by definition — the thought arrived from somewhere else,
and the faster the app gets out of the way the better it has done its job. A drawer would
also be slower to open, slower to dismiss, and would imply a record relationship that does
not exist.

**This does not license** a modal for anything with an id: editing a node, a note, or an
appointment stays in a drawer. If you would return to it and edit it again, it is not
capture. Keep a capture surface extremely lean, so it reads as a tool rather than a form.

**This is the main place we depart from Achieve Planner.** Achieve opens a modal for
everything, and routinely opens modals on top of modals. That is the part of its design
worth leaving behind — the workflow it encodes is excellent; the containers it uses are not.

`ConfirmDialog` in `src/components/detail/` serves the first two cases — the outline's delete
flow and the drawer's unsaved-changes prompt; use it rather than `window.confirm`. Every
centered dialog, including those, is built on `ModalShell`. See `modal-pattern.md`.

The stacked-modal rule bites hardest in the repeating lists inside a detail form — Achieve
opens a second modal to edit an Objective or a Risk. We expand the row in place instead
(`ItemList`).

### Tabs organise sections within a form

Tabs are the **correct** pattern for grouping sections of a complex record form, and this
app uses them exactly as Achieve does — a Project or Result Area opens with its fields
grouped across several tabs.

The original version of this standard argued against tabs. That argument was aimed at using
tabs to represent **individual data items** — one tab per record — which was a quirk of that
app's earlier design and is not something we do. It was never an argument against tabs as a
way to organise sections of a single form.

The distinction that matters:

| Tabs for…                     | Verdict                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sections of one record's form | **Correct.** Use them.              |
| One tab per data item         | Wrong. That's what the grid is for. |

## Editing Triggers

Prefer explicit, discoverable actions over hidden gestures, and standardise whichever
trigger is chosen across every view — users should never have to relearn how to open a
record.

The bindings, which every view must match:

| Gesture                  | Opens                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter`, or double-click | The full record, in a drawer — as Achieve does |
| `F2`                     | Inline name editing, the Windows convention    |

Both also appear as toolbar buttons, and the selected row carries a small open-record
affordance — a gesture nobody can see is not a discoverable action.

Below `md`, **single tap** opens the record and **long press** opens the row menu. Double-click
and right-click do not exist on touch, so these are translations of the same bindings rather
than a second set to learn. `F2` has no compact equivalent — inline rename happens in the
sheet. See `responsive.md`.

### Icon-only controls need a tooltip

A control whose visible content is only a glyph (`‹ ›`, `×`, a chevron, a colour swatch, a
toolbar icon) must have a `title`. The glyph is not a label. `aria-label` is not a
substitute — it is not visible on hover, and this app is used with a mouse.

```tsx
<button type="button" title="Previous month" aria-label="Previous month">
  ‹
</button>
```

- `ToolbarIconButton` already requires `title` in its signature. Same rule for pagers, pane
  toggles, close buttons, colour swatches, expand/collapse chevrons, and any other icon-only
  control.
- When the control is disabled, `title` says **why** (`navigation.md`).
- A button that already shows words does not need a tooltip repeating them.

## Forms & Validation

### Minimise required fields

Only hard-require what is genuinely essential. Ask: "can the system function without this
right now?" If yes, make it optional. In this app almost nothing is truly required — a node
needs a type and a place in the tree; even the name can be filled in later.

### Allow partial saves

Let users save incomplete records. Forcing completeness produces junk data, lost work, and
abandonment — people frequently know a task exists before they know how long it will take.

### Use drawers for complex forms

For forms with many fields, conditional sections, or dropdowns needing room to expand, use
the drawer. Never cram them into grid cells.

### Save stays open; leave is separate

A drawer is a workspace, not a one-shot dialog. For structured record forms (node detail,
appointments) without autosave, commit and leave are independent. Use the shared
`DrawerFooter` — never invent a different button set:

```
[ Cancel ]                          [ Save ]   [ Save & Close ]
```

- **Save** (outlined) commits and **stays open**, with "Saved" / "Unsaved changes" feedback
  (⌘/Ctrl+S).
- **Save & Close** (solid primary, rightmost) commits then leaves (⌘/Ctrl+Enter); failed
  saves stay open.
- **Cancel** (ghost, left) / header × / Escape leave the drawer; if dirty, confirm discard.

Do not make a single Save that always closes — that forces reopen thrashing across tabs.
Do not ship only stay-open Save either: finishing an edit then becomes Save + Cancel every
time. Document-like surfaces (notes, session log) **autosave** instead; short nested
sub-editors may treat Save as done (Cancel + Save only). Details live in
`drawer-pattern.md`.

### Inline validation

- Validate **on blur**, not while typing.
- Error messages must be **specific and actionable** — "Effort must look like 2 h, 45 min,
  or 3:45 h", not "Invalid input".
- Clear the error state as soon as the user corrects it.
- Keep **Save** available unless a submit is in progress; show blocking errors on the save
  attempt rather than disabling the button.
- Unparseable input in a grid cell **reverts to the stored value and flags the cell** rather
  than saving something wrong or silently clearing it.
  Validation here is light by design (see partial saves); it is still not a reason to close
  on Save — stay open so a rare failure can be fixed in place.

## database/migrations

# Migrations

Drizzle, `drizzle/` for the SQL, `drizzle/meta/` for the snapshots it diffs against.

## Changing the schema

```sh
# 1. edit src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:generate     # writes drizzle/NNNN_name.sql + meta/NNNN_snapshot.json + journal entry
# 2. read the generated SQL before trusting it
npm run db:migrate      # applies it locally
```

Commit the **`.sql`, the snapshot, and the `_journal.json` entry together**. They are one
change; a commit with two of the three is the bug described below.

## Never hand-write a migration without its snapshot

`db:generate` diffs the _last snapshot_ against `schema.ts`. Drop one and the next generate
diffs from a stale baseline, emits SQL that re-creates things that already exist, and has to
be hand-written too — which drops another snapshot. **One omission poisons every migration
after it.**

That is not hypothetical: `0004` (commit `566a565`) shipped a `.sql` and a journal entry
with no snapshot, `0005`–`0008` were then all hand-written, and `db:generate` was unusable
for five migrations. `0007` made it worse by adding a snapshot that was the `0003` schema
re-stamped with new ids — a _wrong_ snapshot is worse than a missing one, because drizzle
believes it.

If you genuinely must hand-write SQL that `generate` cannot express (a backfill, a
data-preserving column swap), still regenerate the snapshot afterwards so the chain stays
intact.

**Current state:** repaired as of `0008`. Snapshots `0004`–`0006` are absent and `0007` is
wrong; they are left as history. Only the newest snapshot matters for diffing, and that one
is correct — `db:generate` works and reports "No schema changes" against a clean tree.

## Hand-written SQL, when unavoidable

Statements are separated by a breakpoint marker, and a column swap keeps the data:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "appointments" ADD COLUMN "check_state" "appointment_check" DEFAULT 'open' NOT NULL;--> statement-breakpoint
UPDATE "appointments" SET "check_state" = CASE WHEN "completed" THEN 'done'::"appointment_check" ELSE 'open'::"appointment_check" END;--> statement-breakpoint
ALTER TABLE "appointments" DROP COLUMN "completed";
```

Add the column, backfill it, then drop the old one — never drop first.

## Connections

Migrations run over **`DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`**, never the pooler
(`drizzle.config.ts` falls back to `DATABASE_URL`). Neon's pooled endpoint is
transaction-mode, where DDL like `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` fails with an unhelpful error.
Locally the two are the same string.

## Production

`npm run build` runs `scripts/migrate-on-deploy.mjs` before `next build`, so schema and code
ship together — a past deploy shipped code querying tables Neon did not have yet.

It is gated hard on `VERCEL_ENV === "production"`. **Preview deployments share the one Neon
database**; without the gate, a push to any branch could reshape production's schema. A
failed migration fails the build rather than deploying code whose tables do not exist.

## `db:push` — local scratch only

`db:push` writes `schema.ts` straight to a database and produces **no migration file**, so
the files and the database silently diverge. Fine for trying a shape on your own Docker
Postgres; never against Neon, and never as the thing that ships. The change is not real
until `db:generate` has produced a migration.

## `db:seed` is destructive

It **deletes the dev user's nodes, appointments and time charts** before inserting. Never
run it to refresh a database someone is using. To exercise it, point it at a scratch
database — an exported `DATABASE_URL` beats `--env-file`:

```sh
docker exec planner-postgres psql -U planner -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE planner_seedcheck'
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://planner:planner@localhost:5432/planner_seedcheck"
npx drizzle-kit migrate && npm run db:seed
```

## api/agent-tools

# Agent tools

## Routing

- One tool per request: **`POST /api/agent/{tool}`** where `{tool}` is a stable snake_case
  name (`get_context`, `search_nodes`, …).
- Unknown tool → `not_found`.
- Body is the tool's argument object (JSON). No args → `{}`.
- **One write path** — tools call `src/lib/**` mutations/queries only. Do not reimplement
  SQL in the route handler.

## Canonical contract

Define every tool once in a registry containing its name, domain, intent description,
input/output schemas, effects, retry behavior, exposure, and handler. Generate HTTP
discovery, documentation, and future transports from that registry; prose catalogs are not
an independent source of truth.

## Design

1. **Prefer outcomes over endpoint primitives.** Batch repeated approved operations when a
   workflow would otherwise need three or more equivalent calls.
2. **Stable, action-oriented names.** Names are part of the agent contract; rename only
   with a deliberate version or dual-support window.
3. **Descriptions are selection instructions.** Say what the tool does, when to use it,
   when not to use it, its side effects and retry behavior, and what it returns.
4. **Focused exposure.** Keep the default active set small; expose domains on demand and
   identify legacy aliases rather than loading the whole catalog into context.
5. **Summary before detail.** Prefer `get_context`, filtered searches, and compact rows over
   full records. A strict general-purpose escape hatch is allowed when splitting creates
   overlaps or loses necessary full-form capability.
6. **Ids over paths.** Agents mutate UUIDs returned by search/read; human labels are for
   matching and display.
7. **Ask when ambiguous.** If a parent or target is unclear, ask rather than creating or
   changing the most plausible guess.

## Inputs

- The runtime validator and published JSON Schema come from the same strict schema.
- Reject unknown fields. Describe fields and declare required values, enums, defaults,
  nullability, and bounds.
- Prefer flat inputs with roughly eight top-level parameters. Nest only cohesive batches or
  justified full-form escape hatches.
- Validation errors name the field and a correction.

## Outputs

- Return IDs, human labels, and fields needed for the next decision.
- Lists use compact summaries and disclose returned count, total count, and whether more
  results exist. Full prose belongs in a targeted detail tool.
- Never silently truncate or place full prose blobs in summary results.
- Keep the stable HTTP envelope from `api/response-format.md`; tool output schemas describe
  the value under `data`.

## Safety and recovery

- Classify read/write behavior, destructive effects, confirmation needs, and idempotency.
- Enforce a retry guarantee with a natural key or transaction. Never claim retry safety
  across a non-atomic external side effect.
- Preserve user control before destructive or bulk work.
- Foreign rows are never exposed. Missing and foreign identifiers have the same `not_found`
  response shape.

## Testing

- Test registry/schema completeness, unknown-field rejection, HTTP envelopes, user
  isolation, truncation metadata, retry behavior, and documentation generation.
- Exercise representative tasks for selection accuracy, call count, response size, and
  error recovery. Prioritize plausible silent errors over exhaustive happy-path examples.
- Pure argument parsing/filtering → unit tests beside the module.
- Tool functions that touch the database → `*.integration.test.ts` with a second-user case.
- Route handlers remain thin wrappers (auth + dispatch); test both the registry boundary and
  representative HTTP envelopes.
