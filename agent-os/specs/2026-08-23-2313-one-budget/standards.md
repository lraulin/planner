# Standards for Collapse Budget, Schedules and Commitments

The following standards apply to this work.

---

## database/migrations

# Migrations

Drizzle, `drizzle/` for the SQL, `drizzle/meta/` for the snapshots it diffs against.

## Changing the schema

```sh
# 1. edit src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:generate     # writes drizzle/NNNN_name.sql + meta/NNNN_snapshot.json + journal entry
# 2. read the generated SQL before trusting it
npm run db:migrate      # applies it locally
```

Commit the **`.sql`, the snapshot, and the `_journal.json` entry together**. They are one
change; a commit with two of the three is the bug described below.

## Never hand-write a migration without its snapshot

`db:generate` diffs the _last snapshot_ against `schema.ts`. Drop one and the next generate
diffs from a stale baseline, emits SQL that re-creates things that already exist, and has to
be hand-written too — which drops another snapshot. **One omission poisons every migration
after it.**

That is not hypothetical: `0004` (commit `566a565`) shipped a `.sql` and a journal entry
with no snapshot, `0005`–`0008` were then all hand-written, and `db:generate` was unusable
for five migrations. `0007` made it worse by adding a snapshot that was the `0003` schema
re-stamped with new ids — a _wrong_ snapshot is worse than a missing one, because drizzle
believes it.

If you genuinely must hand-write SQL that `generate` cannot express (a backfill, a
data-preserving column swap), still regenerate the snapshot afterwards so the chain stays
intact.

**Current state:** repaired as of `0008`. Snapshots `0004`–`0006` are absent and `0007` is
wrong; they are left as history. Only the newest snapshot matters for diffing, and that one
is correct — `db:generate` works and reports "No schema changes" against a clean tree.

## Hand-written SQL, when unavoidable

Statements are separated by a breakpoint marker, and a column swap keeps the data:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "appointments" ADD COLUMN "check_state" "appointment_check" DEFAULT 'open' NOT NULL;--> statement-breakpoint
UPDATE "appointments" SET "check_state" = CASE WHEN "completed" THEN 'done'::"appointment_check" ELSE 'open'::"appointment_check" END;--> statement-breakpoint
ALTER TABLE "appointments" DROP COLUMN "completed";
```

Add the column, backfill it, then drop the old one — never drop first.

## Connections

Migrations run over **`DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`**, never the pooler
(`drizzle.config.ts` falls back to `DATABASE_URL`). Neon's pooled endpoint is
transaction-mode, where DDL like `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` fails with an unhelpful error.
Locally the two are the same string.

## Production

`npm run build` runs `scripts/migrate-on-deploy.mjs` before `next build`, so schema and code
ship together — a past deploy shipped code querying tables Neon did not have yet.

It is gated hard on `VERCEL_ENV === "production"`. **Preview deployments share the one Neon
database**; without the gate, a push to any branch could reshape production's schema. A
failed migration fails the build rather than deploying code whose tables do not exist.

## `db:push` — local scratch only

`db:push` writes `schema.ts` straight to a database and produces **no migration file**, so
the files and the database silently diverge. Fine for trying a shape on your own Docker
Postgres; never against Neon, and never as the thing that ships. The change is not real
until `db:generate` has produced a migration.

## `db:seed` is destructive

It **deletes the dev user's nodes, appointments and time charts** before inserting. Never
run it to refresh a database someone is using. To exercise it, point it at a scratch
database — an exported `DATABASE_URL` beats `--env-file`:

```sh
docker exec planner-postgres psql -U planner -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE planner_seedcheck'
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://planner:planner@localhost:5432/planner_seedcheck"
npx drizzle-kit migrate && npm run db:seed
```

## development/clean-code

# Clean code

Most of the code here is written by an agent and reviewed by one person in a hurry. That
changes what "clean" is for. It is not craftsmanship for its own sake — refactoring is
cheap now, so the old argument from cost is weaker. What is expensive is **review** and
**being wrong in a plausible-looking way**.

So the principles that survive are the ones that make code (a) easy to skim and trust in a
diff, and (b) safe for an agent to change one part of without breaking a distant part.
Names, small units, hard boundaries, boring consistency, and testability. Everything below
is one of those five wearing a different hat.

## The layers, and which way dependencies point

This is the highest-value rule in the file. It is what lets an agent work inside
`src/lib/fitness/` without touching the schedule.

```
src/app/**          routes, pages, and actions.ts — thin
  ↓
src/components/**   presentation and interaction
  ↓
src/lib/<domain>/   the real logic: pure modules, queries.ts, mutations.ts, types.ts
  ↓
src/db/             Drizzle schema and the client
```

Concretely:

- **`src/lib/**` never imports from `src/app/**`.** It does not know it is in a web app.
  It imports `@/components` only for a shared _type_ (a column shape), never a component.
- **Components never touch the database.** They may `import type` from `@/db/schema` and
  from a `mutations.ts` (a patch type is part of the contract), but the `db` client itself
  stops at `src/lib`. Components mutate by calling a server action.
- **`actions.ts` is a wrapper, not a place for logic.** It resolves the user, delegates to
  `src/lib`, revalidates, and shapes the result. `src/app/fitness/actions.ts` is the
  reference: one `run()` helper, one line per action. If an action grows a branch, the
  branch belongs in `src/lib`.
- **Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and scopes on it.** No exceptions,
  no ambient current-user lookup inside `src/lib`. See `development/testing.md` for why
  this is also a testing rule.

When a change wants to cross a layer the wrong way, that is the signal to stop and move
logic down, not to add an import.

## Names

Name the concept, not the mechanics. The file names in `src/lib/tree/` are the standard to
hold: `completionCascade.ts`, `shelving.ts`, `owningProject.ts`, `nextActions.ts`. Each one
tells you what domain question it answers before you open it.

- A module is named for the idea it owns, and its test is `<same>.test.ts` beside it.
- Functions read as what they return or do — `matchesFilter`, `flattenLevels`,
  `requireExercise`. `handle`, `process`, `doUpdate` are not names.
- Booleans read as assertions: `isShelved`, `hasChildren`.
- Say the unit when there is one: `weightLb`, `delaySeconds`, `dateKey` — never a bare
  `date` for something that is actually a calendar day string. See `development/dates.md`.
- Match the surrounding spelling, including the British `normalise`/`normaliseEquipment`
  already in `src/lib/fitness/`. Consistency beats your preference.

Good names are also the cheapest prompt engineering available: an agent continues the
patterns it can see, and ambiguous names are what make it invent a second, conflicting one.

## Small units, one reason to change

Pure logic goes in `src/lib/<domain>/` as a small module with a single job, and gets a
sibling test. `src/lib/fitness/` shows the grain: `plates.ts`, `bars.ts`, `restTimer.ts`,
`weightStep.ts` — each a concept, each a few dozen lines, each testable without a database
or a render.

- If a component holds a calculation, a comparison, or a rule with an edge case, that
  belongs in `src/lib`. The component keeps the wiring.
- If a function needs a comment to explain its second half, that half is a function.
- Split by _reason to change_, not by size. `queries.ts` and `mutations.ts` stay separate
  even when both are long, because they change for different reasons.

## Consistency over cleverness

There is one of each thing here. Use it; do not build a second one.

| Concern              | The one implementation                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tabular anything     | `DataGrid` (`src/components/grid/`) — see `components/data-grid.md`         |
| Centered dialog      | `ModalShell` (`src/components/detail/`) — see `components/modal-pattern.md` |
| Record editing       | `Drawer` + `DrawerFooter` — see `components/drawer-pattern.md`              |
| Views and commands   | the registries in `src/components/shell/` — see `components/navigation.md`  |
| Server action result | `run()` / `runQuery()` / `ActionResult` in `src/app/actionResult.ts`        |
| HTTP responses       | `{ ok, data }` / `{ ok, error }` — see `api/response-format.md`             |
| Calendar dates       | `fromDateKey` / `toDateKey` — see `development/dates.md`                    |

A second grid or a bespoke dialog is not a local decision; it is a permanent tax on every
future change and a fork in the pattern an agent will learn from. If the shared component
genuinely cannot do the job, extend the shared component.

The same holds inside a file: copy the error-handling, the import order, and the argument
order of the code next to it, even where you would have chosen differently on a blank page.

## Explicit over implicit; simple over general

- Make data flow visible. Prefer a passed argument to a context lookup, a returned value to
  a mutated parameter, one `if` to a lookup table of one entry.
- **No speculative generality.** Do not add an options object, a strategy parameter, or a
  `<T>` for a second caller that does not exist. When the second caller arrives, generalise
  then — the diff is small and the shape will be right, which it would not have been.
- Comments explain _why_, and are worth writing exactly where the reasoning is non-obvious:
  the header comment in `src/lib/fitness/mutations.ts` ("history rows never cascade from the
  outline") is the model. Comments that restate the code are noise that goes stale.
- Where a rule is deliberately not enforced, say so and say why — the
  `no-unnecessary-condition` note in `eslint.config.mjs` is the model. A future agent will
  otherwise "fix" it.

## Testability

Design so the tricky part can be tested without a browser: pure function in, value out.
That is the practical reason logic lives in `src/lib`. What to test and what to skip is
`development/testing.md` — do not duplicate it here.

## DRY, judiciously

Deduplicate a **business rule** — a rule that must change in one place or be wrong. Priority
ordering, shelving semantics, date encoding: one implementation, always.

Tolerate duplicate _shape_. Two components with similar JSX, two queries with a similar
`where`, are not a violation. Extracting them early produces an abstraction with a boolean
parameter, which is worse than the copy and harder to unpick later. Two occurrences is a
coincidence; three with the same reason to change is a pattern.

## When the model is wrong, change the model

**Prefer the design that is right for the app over the one that is cheap given what exists
today.** When work reveals that the current model is wrong — not merely inconvenient — the
default is to fix the model, including when that means a large migration across several
tables and every reader. "That would touch a lot of files" is a cost to plan around, not a
reason to choose the lesser design.

The tell is a justification that appeals only to the present shape of the code: _the string
is already the join key everywhere_, _those columns already exist_, _the other tables
already assume it_. None of those say the design is right; they say it is entrenched. Weigh
what the app should be in a year, and if today's model is not it, say so plainly and price
the refactor.

**This is not a licence for speculative generality**, and it does not soften the section
above. The distinction is whose problem is being solved:

- **Speculative generality** builds for a caller that does not exist yet. Still forbidden.
- **A model correction** fixes a model that is _already_ wrong for cases that _already_
  exist, and is currently being worked around. That is the one to take.

The practical test: if a workaround is being added because the model cannot express
something true about the data, the model is the bug. Two workarounds for the same missing
concept is the signal — a rule enforced in application code because the schema cannot say
it, a fact recomputed at read time because nothing stores it, a value copied into three
tables because there is no row to point at.

When such a refactor is taken, it gets a spec, and the spec records what was superseded and
why — so the next reader sees a decision, not churn. Large is fine; unexplained is not.

## When an agent writes it

- **Small, reviewable diffs.** A change that touches one domain folder gets read properly;
  a 40-file change gets skimmed and merged on faith.
- **Review agent output like a junior's:** run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and the
  typecheck, and read the diff. Confident, plausible, and wrong is the failure mode.
- **New abstractions, new dependencies, and new shared components need a reason stated in
  the PR or the spec.** Deleting a guard, a check, or a test to make something pass needs a
  louder one.
- **Load the relevant standards before writing** (`/inject-standards`). Stated constraints
  are what keep generated code inside the guardrails.
- Put human effort into the expensive parts — layer boundaries, the data model, the
  `userId` scoping, domain rules — and let the agent do the mechanical work inside them.

## development/testing

# Testing

This is a personal project with one developer and no users to page at 3am. Tests here are
not a quality ritual and not a coverage target — they are a **tripwire**. Their job is to
notice when something quietly stops working: a refactor that drops a `userId` from a
`where` clause, a date helper that shifts by an hour across DST, an agent that "fixes" a
bug by deleting the guard that caught it.

That purpose sets the bar. A test earns its place if it would **fail loudly on a plausible
mistake**. If breaking the code would not break the test, the test is decoration.

## What gets tested

**Pure logic in `src/lib/**` — always.** Recurrence expansion, sort keys, tree slicing,
date geometry, filters. These are cheap to test, hold the trickiest reasoning in the
codebase, and are exactly where a wrong answer looks plausible. Adjacent `foo.test.ts`.

**Database mutations and queries — always, as `*.integration.test.ts`.** Every one of these
takes a `userId` and is expected to scope by it. Prove it: a mutation suite is not done
until it has a case where **a second user tries to read, change, and delete the first
user's row and fails at every step**. A dropped `userId` is one of the easiest mistakes to
make and is completely invisible when you only ever test with one user.

**React components — no.** There is no testing-library setup and adding one is not
currently worth it. The bug class that actually bit this codebase in components was
unhandled promise rejections, and that is caught by the type-aware ESLint rules
(`no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`) far more cheaply than by rendering tests.
If a component grows real logic, extract it to `src/lib/**` and test it there.

**Server actions in `src/app/**/actions.ts` — no.** They are thin wrappers that resolve
the user and delegate. Test what they delegate to.

## What a good test looks like here

- **Name the invariant, not the mechanics.** `"does not let one user rename another's
chart"` survives a rewrite. `"calls db.update with the right args"` does not.
- **Pin behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong**, and say why in a comment when the
  expected value is non-obvious — DST boundaries, end-of-month clamping, inclusive vs
  exclusive range ends, "end after N occurrences" when the window starts later.
- **Prefer real values over mocks.** Integration tests use the real Postgres from
  `npm run db:up`, each under a freshly created user, cleaned up in `afterAll`. Do not mock
  Drizzle — a mocked query proves nothing about the query.
- **Cover the boundary, not every value.** One test for "interval 0 floors to 1" beats six
  tests for intervals 1 through 6.

## What not to write

- Snapshot tests. They pass whatever the code does, which is the opposite of a tripwire.
- Tests that restate the implementation line by line. When the code changes they change
  with it and never catch anything.
- Tests for framework or library behaviour. Drizzle and Vitest are already tested.
- Tests for trivial pass-throughs, getters, or type-only modules.

## When adding a feature

1. Put the real logic in `src/lib/**`, not in the component.
2. Write the pure tests alongside it. If the logic branches on dates, include a DST or
   month-boundary case. Calendar fixtures use **`fromDateKey("2026-08-01")`** and assert
   with **`toDateKey`** — never `new Date("2026-08-01")`, never `getHours() === 0` (stored
   as UTC noon). Keep the Aug 1→Jul 31 regression covered — see `development/dates.md`.
3. If it touches the database, add an `*.integration.test.ts` — including the cross-user
   case.
4. Run `npm test`. The pre-commit hook runs the unit tests and pre-push runs everything,
   but do not make the hook the first time you find out.

## Mechanics

|                        |                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit tests             | `foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`, no database, must stay hermetic    |
| Integration tests      | `foo.integration.test.ts`, real Postgres, one fresh user per test |
| Run everything         | `npm test`                                                        |
| Run only the fast ones | `npm run test:unit`                                               |

Integration tests **skip loudly** when Postgres is unreachable, so a stopped container
never blocks a commit — see `src/lib/testing/database.ts`. That means a green
`npm run test:unit` does **not** mean the database logic passed. Check for the skip
warning before trusting a green run on a change that touched `src/lib/**/mutations.ts` or
`queries.ts`.

## development/dates

# Date and time handling

This app is calendar-day heavy (plans, deadlines, shelves, day pages) with a smaller set
of true instants (created/updated, completion history, appointments). Getting the two kinds
mixed is how completed dates show as the wrong day after a save.

Domain meanings of the four node dates live in `product/date-model.md`. This file is the
**mechanics**: storage, keys, UI, and tests.

Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Drizzle + Postgres. No date-fns / Day.js / Luxon — keep
helpers in `src/lib/schedule/geometry.ts` and `src/lib/dateMath.ts`.

## Two kinds of value

| Kind             | Means                      | Examples                                                                                                            | Store / compare as                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calendar day** | A date with no time of day | deadline, deferred, target start/end, actual start, date completed, day page `day`, note date, all-day Google dates | **UTC noon** of that day in `timestamptz`; key via `toDateKey` |
| **Instant**      | A real moment in time      | `created_at`, `updated_at`, `nodes.completed_at`, `task_completions.completed_at`, timed appointments               | `timestamptz`; compare as instants                             |

Never use one kind’s helpers for the other.

## Why UTC noon (not local midnight)

**Regression this encoding exists to prevent (Lee, 2026-08):** set Date completed to
**Aug 1** → save → field showed **Jul 31**. Target start/deferred correctly went to Aug 8.

What happened:

1. Browser in US Eastern stored **local midnight** Aug 1 → `2026-08-01T04:00:00.000Z`
2. Server process in **UTC** ran `startOfDay` → `2026-08-01T00:00:00.000Z`
3. Browser read with **local** getters → evening of **Jul 31**

So calendar days are encoded as **UTC noon of the intended `YYYY-MM-DD`**. Then `toDateKey`
(UTC date components) returns the same key on every machine. Do **not** “fix” with
`startOfDay` on the server — that is process-local and reintroduces the bug.

“Is it still Tuesday **for me**?” is different — that uses **`localDateKey`** / `useToday`
(wall clock of an instant).

## Core rules

1. **Postgres timestamps are timezone-aware** (`timestamptz`).
2. **Every calendar-field write** goes through `fromDateKey` / `asCalendarDay` / `recordDate`
   (detail) — never raw `startOfDay`, never process-local midnight.
3. **Every calendar-field read** for display/compare uses `toDateKey` (UTC components of the
   stored encoding).
4. **Never `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`** (UTC midnight) and never process-local
   `new Date(y, m - 1, d)` in shared server/client code.
5. **Never `date.toISOString().slice(0, 10)` ad hoc** — call `toDateKey` or `localDateKey`.
6. **Bare `YYYY-MM-DD` strings** (day page URLs, day keys) are labels; shift with
   `shiftDateKey` / `daysBetweenKeys`.
7. **Instants stay instants** until display (`completedAt` history vs `dateCompleted` day).
8. **No business rule may depend on the server’s `TZ`.** Pass `today: string | null` into
   pure helpers. UI “today” is `localDateKey` on the client.

## Canonical helpers

| Need                           | Use                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stored calendar Date → day key | `toDateKey` (UTC components)                           |
| Day key → stored Date          | `fromDateKey` (UTC noon)                               |
| Normalize any Date → calendar  | `asCalendarDay` (= `fromDateKey(toDateKey(…))`)        |
| Wall-clock day of an instant   | `localDateKey`                                         |
| “Today” in the UI              | `useToday()` → `localDateKey(new Date())` or `null`    |
| Add days then store calendar   | `asCalendarDay(addDays(…))` (see recurrence)           |
| Whole days between keys        | `daysBetweenKeys`                                      |
| Date input                     | `DateField` — `toDateKey` display, `fromDateKey` write |

`startOfDay` / `addDays` in `dateMath.ts` are **local wall-clock** helpers for appointment
_times_ and intermediate math. After stepping a **calendar** field, re-encode with
`asCalendarDay` before writing.

## Database

- Prefer `timestamptz` for every timestamp column.
- Calendar-day columns: only the date half is meaningful; writers store **UTC noon**.
- Instant columns store the true moment.
- Record dates (`actual_start_date`, `date_completed`): never in the future; clamp on write.
  See `product/date-model.md`.

## Forms and detail drawer

- `DateField` shows `toDateKey(value)` and writes `fromDateKey(picked)`.
- Plan dates on `nodes` (deadline, deferred, target start/end) are re-encoded with
  `asCalendarDay` on save.
- **Record** fields: `max={localDateKey(new Date())}`; server uses `recordDate`.
- Completing a task stamps `date_completed` with `asCalendarDay(at)`, not `startOfDay(at)`.
  Recurrence moves plan dates with `asCalendarDay` after `addDays`.

## Display and grids

- Grid date columns: `toDateKey(date)`.
- Overdue / “today” comparisons: field’s `toDateKey` vs `useToday()` (`localDateKey`).
- Standalone exact values (grid cells, compact rows, filter labels, linked-record dates):
  format the canonical key through `useDateFormatter()` in components, or pass the user's
  `DateFormatId` into pure `src/lib/**` helpers. The Achieve-compatible default is
  `M/D/YYYY`.
- `formatDateKey` reads written `YYYY-MM-DD` components and uses a closed English preset
  catalogue. It never parses the key as an instant and invalid keys render blank.
- Formatting is presentation only. Sorting, filtering, comparisons, native date inputs,
  route keys, and stored values remain canonical `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Long values keep their existing column tracks and truncate with a full-date tooltip.
  Partial formats also expose the full date on hover.
- Contextual calendar labels keep their own purpose-specific format: day and week headings,
  ranges, mini-month labels, chart axes, timestamps, and planning prose do not follow the
  standalone preference.

## Testing (required regressions)

Calendar fixtures: `fromDateKey("2026-08-01")`. Assert with `toDateKey`. Do **not** assert
`getHours() === 0` (values are UTC noon).

**The suite runs in a pinned zone** — `TZ: "America/New_York"` in `vitest.config.ts`. Some
tests are _about_ local wall clock (the DST spring-forward in `recurrence.test.ts`, the
Aug 1 → Jul 31 story below) and only mean anything in a named zone; the rest must not care.
That is the point of the pin: a test that changes its answer with the machine's zone is
either testing the wrong thing or using a local-midnight fixture where the standard above
says `fromDateKey`. Do not remove it to "fix" a failure — the pin is what makes CI, a Vercel
build (UTC) and a laptop agree.

Must keep green:

1. **Round-trip:** `toDateKey(fromDateKey(k)) === k` for several keys.
2. **Aug 1 / Jul 31:** encoding survives “server UTC + client Eastern” story (see
   `geometry.test.ts` and detail mutation integration tests).
3. **Complete-via-date + regenerate:** complete on day D → `dateCompleted` key is D, deferred
   / target start are D+interval (not D−1).
4. **No re-cycle** when the same calendar day is re-saved on a recurring task.

## Common pitfalls

# Agent tools

## Routing

- One tool per request: **`POST /api/agent/{tool}`** where `{tool}` is a stable snake_case
  name (`get_context`, `search_nodes`, …).
- Unknown tool → `not_found`.
- Body is the tool's argument object (JSON). No args → `{}`.
- **One write path** — tools call `src/lib/**` mutations/queries only. Do not reimplement
  SQL in the route handler.

## Canonical contract

Define every tool once in a registry containing its name, domain, intent description,
input/output schemas, effects, retry behavior, exposure, and handler. Generate HTTP
discovery, documentation, and future transports from that registry; prose catalogs are not
an independent source of truth.

## Design

1. **Prefer outcomes over endpoint primitives.** Batch repeated approved operations when a
   workflow would otherwise need three or more equivalent calls.
2. **Stable, action-oriented names.** Names are part of the agent contract; rename only
   with a deliberate version or dual-support window.
3. **Descriptions are selection instructions.** Say what the tool does, when to use it,
   when not to use it, its side effects and retry behavior, and what it returns.
4. **Focused exposure.** Keep the default active set small; expose domains on demand and
   identify legacy aliases rather than loading the whole catalog into context.
5. **Summary before detail.** Prefer `get_context`, filtered searches, and compact rows over
   full records. A strict general-purpose escape hatch is allowed when splitting creates
   overlaps or loses necessary full-form capability.
6. **Ids over paths.** Agents mutate UUIDs returned by search/read; human labels are for
   matching and display.
7. **Ask when ambiguous.** If a parent or target is unclear, ask rather than creating or
   changing the most plausible guess.

## Inputs

- The runtime validator and published JSON Schema come from the same strict schema.
- Reject unknown fields. Describe fields and declare required values, enums, defaults,
  nullability, and bounds.
- Prefer flat inputs with roughly eight top-level parameters. Nest only cohesive batches or
  justified full-form escape hatches.
- Validation errors name the field and a correction.

## Outputs

- Return IDs, human labels, and fields needed for the next decision.
- Lists use compact summaries and disclose returned count, total count, and whether more
  results exist. Full prose belongs in a targeted detail tool.
- Never silently truncate or place full prose blobs in summary results.
- Keep the stable HTTP envelope from `api/response-format.md`; tool output schemas describe
  the value under `data`.

## Safety and recovery

- Classify read/write behavior, destructive effects, confirmation needs, and idempotency.
- Enforce a retry guarantee with a natural key or transaction. Never claim retry safety
  across a non-atomic external side effect.
- Preserve user control before destructive or bulk work.
- Foreign rows are never exposed. Missing and foreign identifiers have the same `not_found`
  response shape.

## Testing

- Test registry/schema completeness, unknown-field rejection, HTTP envelopes, user
  isolation, truncation metadata, retry behavior, and documentation generation.
- Exercise representative tasks for selection accuracy, call count, response size, and
  error recovery. Prioritize plausible silent errors over exhaustive happy-path examples.
- Pure argument parsing/filtering → unit tests beside the module.
- Tool functions that touch the database → `*.integration.test.ts` with a second-user case.
- Route handlers remain thin wrappers (auth + dispatch); test both the registry boundary and
  representative HTTP envelopes.

## components/data-grid (excerpt — see full file for cell/toolbar API details)

Full file: `agent-os/standards/components/data-grid.md` (634 lines). Read in full
before building the merged grid in Task 5 — it governs the single shared `DataGrid`
this spec adds `GridToolbar`/`useModuleViews` to, hierarchy-under-sort/filter/group,
the three-rung filter disclosure, `useNavigableIds`, and why no grid library is used.
