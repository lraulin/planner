# UI/UX Design Principles

The design philosophy behind our component patterns. Read this before the
implementation-focused standards (`drawer-pattern.md`) — it explains _why_ those patterns
exist.

Adapted from the same standard in Lee's `wrcs/reactwrcs` project, where these principles
emerged from iterating through grid → tabs → modals → grid+drawer during 2025–2026. They
align with patterns used in Linear, Supabase, Retool, and other modern tools. Where this
document differs from the original, it is because Achieve Planner's model differs — see
**Tabs** below.

## Core Principles

- **Context preservation** — never hide the outline unless absolutely necessary. It is the
  user's map of everything they have committed to; losing sight of it is disorienting.
- **Consistency** — the same patterns across every view, and aligned with conventions users
  already know from elsewhere.
- **Clarity over cleverness** — if users have to guess how to do something, the design has
  already failed.
- **Error prevention > error recovery** — make dangerous or irreversible actions hard to do
  by accident.
- **Progressive disclosure** — show only what's needed now; hide complexity until relevant.
- **Immediate, clear feedback** for every action.
- **Keyboard first** — this app replaces a keyboard-driven Windows tool. Anything reachable
  by mouse should be reachable by key, and the primary workflows should be faster by
  keyboard than by mouse.
- **Accessibility is not a goal here** — one user, no screen reader, not public. Skip ARIA
  coverage, contrast ratios and screen-reader testing; add them if this is ever released.
  Keep the handful of roles and labels that are load-bearing for other reasons (see
  `modal-pattern.md`) — they are wiring, not compliance.
- **Performance is UX** — slow expand/collapse or heavy re-renders destroy usability in a
  dense grid.
- **Forgiveness & safety** — let users recover easily; never force inaccurate data entry.

## Layout & Navigation

### Grid + drawer is the default

The **outline grid + right-sliding drawer** is the standard pattern for list + form work
(see `drawer-pattern.md`):

- **Grid** for scanning, filtering, reordering, and fast inline edits
- **Drawer** for the full record — the grid stays visible, preserving context

### Inline editing for grid-visible fields

Fields that appear as grid columns — name, priority, effort, deadline, state, focus — are
edited **in place**. Opening a drawer to change a priority would be absurd. The drawer is
for the fields that don't fit on a row.

Where a value is a rollup of its descendants (a parent's effort), the cell is **read-only**.
Never offer an editor whose result would be invisible behind a computed value.

### Avoid modals for routine editing

Modals hide context, increase cognitive load, and feel interruptive. Reserve them for:

- **Destructive confirmations** — "Delete this project and everything under it?"
- **Critical blocking actions** where the user _must_ decide before continuing
- **Fast capture** — a transient, keyboard-invoked surface that owns no record

Never use a modal for a standard create/edit flow.

#### The capture exception

Quick capture (`QuickCaptureDialog`) is a modal on what looks like a create flow, and is
still right. The discriminator is **whether context preservation is wanted**:

|                      | Standard create/edit | Fast capture            |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose              | Full record editing  | Get it out of your head |
| Context preservation | High                 | **Low, intentionally**  |
| Bound to a record    | Yes                  | No — nothing exists yet |
| Bulk / freeform text | No                   | Yes                     |
| Pattern              | Drawer               | Modal                   |

The rule protects your view of the outline while you work _on_ something in it. During
capture the outline is irrelevant by definition — the thought arrived from somewhere else,
and the faster the app gets out of the way the better it has done its job. A drawer would
also be slower to open, slower to dismiss, and would imply a record relationship that does
not exist.

**This does not license** a modal for anything with an id: editing a node, a note, or an
appointment stays in a drawer. If you would return to it and edit it again, it is not
capture. Keep a capture surface extremely lean, so it reads as a tool rather than a form.

**This is the main place we depart from Achieve Planner.** Achieve opens a modal for
everything, and routinely opens modals on top of modals. That is the part of its design
worth leaving behind — the workflow it encodes is excellent; the containers it uses are not.

`ConfirmDialog` in `src/components/detail/` serves the first two cases — the outline's delete
flow and the drawer's unsaved-changes prompt; use it rather than `window.confirm`. Every
centered dialog, including those, is built on `ModalShell`. See `modal-pattern.md`.

The stacked-modal rule bites hardest in the repeating lists inside a detail form — Achieve
opens a second modal to edit an Objective or a Risk. We expand the row in place instead
(`ItemList`).

### Tabs organise sections within a form

Tabs are the **correct** pattern for grouping sections of a complex record form, and this
app uses them exactly as Achieve does — a Project or Result Area opens with its fields
grouped across several tabs.

The original version of this standard argued against tabs. That argument was aimed at using
tabs to represent **individual data items** — one tab per record — which was a quirk of that
app's earlier design and is not something we do. It was never an argument against tabs as a
way to organise sections of a single form.

The distinction that matters:

| Tabs for…                     | Verdict                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sections of one record's form | **Correct.** Use them.              |
| One tab per data item         | Wrong. That's what the grid is for. |

## Editing Triggers

Prefer explicit, discoverable actions over hidden gestures, and standardise whichever
trigger is chosen across every view — users should never have to relearn how to open a
record.

The bindings, which every view must match:

| Gesture                  | Opens                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter`, or double-click | The full record, in a drawer — as Achieve does |
| `F2`                     | Inline name editing, the Windows convention    |

Both also appear as toolbar buttons, and the selected row carries a small open-record
affordance — a gesture nobody can see is not a discoverable action.

## Forms & Validation

### Minimise required fields

Only hard-require what is genuinely essential. Ask: "can the system function without this
right now?" If yes, make it optional. In this app almost nothing is truly required — a node
needs a type and a place in the tree; even the name can be filled in later.

### Allow partial saves

Let users save incomplete records. Forcing completeness produces junk data, lost work, and
abandonment — people frequently know a task exists before they know how long it will take.

### Use drawers for complex forms

For forms with many fields, conditional sections, or dropdowns needing room to expand, use
the drawer. Never cram them into grid cells.

### Inline validation

- Validate **on blur**, not while typing.
- Error messages must be **specific and actionable** — "Effort must look like 2 h, 45 min,
  or 3:45 h", not "Invalid input".
- Clear the error state as soon as the user corrects it.
- Keep **Save** available unless a submit is in progress; show blocking errors on the save
  attempt rather than disabling the button.
- Unparseable input in a grid cell **reverts to the stored value and flags the cell** rather
  than saving something wrong or silently clearing it.

## Decision Guide

| Question                                              | If yes →                       | If no →                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Is the field already a grid column?                   | Edit inline                    | Drawer                                           |
| Is the value a rollup of descendants?                 | Read-only                      | Editable                                         |
| Are there more than 3–4 fields to edit at once?       | Drawer (not modal, not inline) | Inline is fine                                   |
| Does the form have distinct groups of fields?         | Tabs within the drawer         | A single scrolling pane                          |
| Is this destructive or irreversible?                  | Confirmation dialog            | Just do it, with clear feedback                  |
| Does it edit a record that already exists?            | Drawer, never a modal          | A modal may be right — see the capture exception |
| Does the user need the outline visible while editing? | Drawer                         | Drawer is still fine                             |

## components/modal-pattern

# Modal Pattern

> For _when_ a modal is allowed at all, see `ux-principles.md`. Three cases only.

Every centered dialog is built on **`ModalShell`** (`src/components/detail/ModalShell.tsx`).
Never hand-roll the backdrop — four dialogs each carried their own copy before it was
extracted, and they had already drifted apart on backdrop opacity.

```tsx
const titleId = useId();

<ModalShell open={open} onClose={close} labelledBy={titleId} width="max-w-lg">
  <div className="p-5">
    <h2 id={titleId}>Show Fields</h2>…
  </div>
</ModalShell>;
```

`ModalShell` supplies the backdrop and click-away, focus-in / Tab-trap / focus-restore
(`useModalFocus`), the Escape handler, and the `role` wiring. It renders nothing when `open`
is false. **Padding is yours** — the shell sets no padding so a dialog can have a flush
header or footer.

Focus handling stays for keyboard reasons, not accessibility ones: it is why Escape returns
you to the row you opened the dialog from, and why Tab does not wander into the grid behind
it.

## Rules

- **The `role` is functional, not decoration.** `"alertdialog"` for a destructive
  confirmation, `"dialog"` for everything else — and `isModalOpen()` finds a dialog by
  exactly these, so dropping the role breaks the capture shortcut's guard (below).
- **`labelledBy` points at the dialog's own heading.** A `useId` and an `id` on the `<h2>`;
  it keeps every dialog's API uniform for no real cost.
- **Escape is handled in the capture phase.** A grid's own keydown listener would otherwise
  see it first and cancel an inline edit _behind_ the dialog.
- **A visible button always accompanies a keyboard shortcut.** Touch has no Enter key, and
  a gesture nobody can see is not a discoverable action.

## Unmount a dialog that holds a draft

**Closing discards. Unmount the dialog rather than hiding it**, so the next open starts
clean:

```tsx
{
  open && <QuickCaptureDialog onClose={close} />;
} // not: <Dialog open={open} …>
```

Both draft-holding dialogs do this — `NoteFilterDialog` via an outer wrapper that returns
`null`, `QuickCaptureDialog` via the parent. It is what makes Cancel mean cancel, and it
avoids the bug it replaces: reseeding state from props inside an effect.

Passing `open` down and letting `ModalShell` unrender is right only for a dialog with no
draft of its own, like `ConfirmDialog`.

## Closing is the success signal

A failed submit **keeps the dialog open** and renders the error inline; a successful one
closes it. So the dialog disappearing is what tells the user it worked — the same rule
`drawer-pattern.md` states as "never close a drawer over a failed save".

Do not add a toast on top of that. There are none in the app, and a feedback convention
should be chosen for the whole app rather than introduced by whichever feature happened to
want one first.

## Modals are invisible to their own guard unless they use the shell

The app-wide capture shortcut suppresses itself with `isModalOpen()`
(`src/lib/keyboard.ts`), which queries `[role="dialog"], [role="alertdialog"]`. A dialog
built outside `ModalShell`, or missing its `role`, will not be seen — and `c` will open
quick capture on top of it.

## Deliberately not provided

No stacking, no scroll lock, no portal. Nothing here needs them, and `ux-principles.md`
names stacked modals as the specific Achieve behaviour worth leaving behind. If you find
yourself wanting a second modal over the first, the second one is probably a drawer.

## development/testing

# Testing

This is a personal project with one developer and no users to page at 3am. Tests here are
not a quality ritual and not a coverage target — they are a **tripwire**. Their job is to
notice when something quietly stops working: a refactor that drops a `userId` from a
`where` clause, a date helper that shifts by an hour across DST, an agent that "fixes" a
bug by deleting the guard that caught it.

That purpose sets the bar. A test earns its place if it would **fail loudly on a plausible
mistake**. If breaking the code would not break the test, the test is decoration.

## What gets tested

**Pure logic in `src/lib/**` — always.** Recurrence expansion, sort keys, tree slicing,
date geometry, filters. These are cheap to test, hold the trickiest reasoning in the
codebase, and are exactly where a wrong answer looks plausible. Adjacent `foo.test.ts`.

**Database mutations and queries — always, as `*.integration.test.ts`.** Every one of these
takes a `userId` and is expected to scope by it. Prove it: a mutation suite is not done
until it has a case where **a second user tries to read, change, and delete the first
user's row and fails at every step**. A dropped `userId` is one of the easiest mistakes to
make and is completely invisible when you only ever test with one user.

**React components — no.** There is no testing-library setup and adding one is not
currently worth it. The bug class that actually bit this codebase in components was
unhandled promise rejections, and that is caught by the type-aware ESLint rules
(`no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`) far more cheaply than by rendering tests.
If a component grows real logic, extract it to `src/lib/**` and test it there.

**Server actions in `src/app/**/actions.ts` — no.** They are thin wrappers that resolve
the user and delegate. Test what they delegate to.

## What a good test looks like here

- **Name the invariant, not the mechanics.** `"does not let one user rename another's
chart"` survives a rewrite. `"calls db.update with the right args"` does not.
- **Pin behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong**, and say why in a comment when the
  expected value is non-obvious — DST boundaries, end-of-month clamping, inclusive vs
  exclusive range ends, "end after N occurrences" when the window starts later.
- **Prefer real values over mocks.** Integration tests use the real Postgres from
  `npm run db:up`, each under a freshly created user, cleaned up in `afterAll`. Do not mock
  Drizzle — a mocked query proves nothing about the query.
- **Cover the boundary, not every value.** One test for "interval 0 floors to 1" beats six
  tests for intervals 1 through 6.

## What not to write

- Snapshot tests. They pass whatever the code does, which is the opposite of a tripwire.
- Tests that restate the implementation line by line. When the code changes they change
  with it and never catch anything.
- Tests for framework or library behaviour. Drizzle and Vitest are already tested.
- Tests for trivial pass-throughs, getters, or type-only modules.

## When adding a feature

1. Put the real logic in `src/lib/**`, not in the component.
2. Write the pure tests alongside it. If the logic branches on dates, include a DST or
   month-boundary case.
3. If it touches the database, add an `*.integration.test.ts` — including the cross-user
   case.
4. Run `npm test`. The pre-commit hook runs the unit tests and pre-push runs everything,
   but do not make the hook the first time you find out.

## Mechanics

|                        |                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit tests             | `foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`, no database, must stay hermetic    |
| Integration tests      | `foo.integration.test.ts`, real Postgres, one fresh user per test |
| Run everything         | `npm test`                                                        |
| Run only the fast ones | `npm run test:unit`                                               |

Integration tests **skip loudly** when Postgres is unreachable, so a stopped container
never blocks a commit — see `src/lib/testing/database.ts`. That means a green
`npm run test:unit` does **not** mean the database logic passed. Check for the skip
warning before trusting a green run on a change that touched `src/lib/**/mutations.ts` or
`queries.ts`.
