# Standards for Weekly Schedule

The following standards apply to this work.

## components/ux-principles

**Why it applies:** Appointment and Time Chart editing must use drawers (not Achieve’s
stacked modals). Keyboard-first, progressive disclosure, and ConfirmDialog for destructive
/ dirty-close apply to the schedule surface the same way as the outline and grids.

# UI/UX Design Principles

The design philosophy behind our component patterns. Read this before the
implementation-focused standards (`drawer-pattern.md`) — it explains _why_ those patterns
exist.

Adapted from the same standard in Lee's `wrcs/reactwrcs` project, where these principles
emerged from iterating through grid → tabs → modals → grid+drawer during 2025–2026. They
align with patterns used in Linear, Supabase, Retool, and other modern tools. Where this
document differs from the original, it is because Achieve Planner's model differs — see
**Tabs** below.

## Core Principles

- **Context preservation** — never hide the outline unless absolutely necessary. It is the
  user's map of everything they have committed to; losing sight of it is disorienting.
- **Consistency** — the same patterns across every view, and aligned with conventions users
  already know from elsewhere.
- **Clarity over cleverness** — if users have to guess how to do something, the design has
  already failed.
- **Error prevention > error recovery** — make dangerous or irreversible actions hard to do
  by accident.
- **Progressive disclosure** — show only what's needed now; hide complexity until relevant.
- **Immediate, clear feedback** for every action.
- **Keyboard first** — this app replaces a keyboard-driven Windows tool. Anything reachable
  by mouse should be reachable by key, and the primary workflows should be faster by
  keyboard than by mouse.
- **Accessibility is not optional** — ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management, contrast.
- **Performance is UX** — slow expand/collapse or heavy re-renders destroy usability in a
  dense grid.
- **Forgiveness & safety** — let users recover easily; never force inaccurate data entry.

## Layout & Navigation

### Grid + drawer is the default

The **outline grid + right-sliding drawer** is the standard pattern for list + form work
(see `drawer-pattern.md`):

- **Grid** for scanning, filtering, reordering, and fast inline edits
- **Drawer** for the full record — the grid stays visible, preserving context

### Inline editing for grid-visible fields

Fields that appear as grid columns — name, priority, effort, deadline, state, focus — are
edited **in place**. Opening a drawer to change a priority would be absurd. The drawer is
for the fields that don't fit on a row.

Where a value is a rollup of its descendants (a parent's effort), the cell is **read-only**.
Never offer an editor whose result would be invisible behind a computed value.

### Avoid modals for routine editing

Modals hide context, increase cognitive load, and feel interruptive. Reserve them for:

- **Destructive confirmations** — "Delete this project and everything under it?"
- **Critical blocking actions** where the user _must_ decide before continuing

Never use a modal for a standard create/edit flow.

**This is the main place we depart from Achieve Planner.** Achieve opens a modal for
everything, and routinely opens modals on top of modals. That is the part of its design
worth leaving behind — the workflow it encodes is excellent; the containers it uses are not.

`ConfirmDialog` in `src/components/detail/` is the component for both permitted cases. It
serves the outline's delete flow and the drawer's unsaved-changes prompt; use it rather than
`window.confirm`.

The stacked-modal rule bites hardest in the repeating lists inside a detail form — Achieve
opens a second modal to edit an Objective or a Risk. We expand the row in place instead
(`ItemList`).

### Tabs organise sections within a form

Tabs are the **correct** pattern for grouping sections of a complex record form, and this
app uses them exactly as Achieve does — a Project or Result Area opens with its fields
grouped across several tabs.

The original version of this standard argued against tabs. That argument was aimed at using
tabs to represent **individual data items** — one tab per record — which was a quirk of that
app's earlier design and is not something we do. It was never an argument against tabs as a
way to organise sections of a single form.

The distinction that matters:

| Tabs for…                     | Verdict                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sections of one record's form | **Correct.** Use them.              |
| One tab per data item         | Wrong. That's what the grid is for. |

## Editing Triggers

Prefer explicit, discoverable actions over hidden gestures, and standardise whichever
trigger is chosen across every view — users should never have to relearn how to open a
record.

The bindings, which every view must match:

| Gesture                  | Opens                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Enter`, or double-click | The full record, in a drawer — as Achieve does |
| `F2`                     | Inline name editing, the Windows convention    |

Both also appear as toolbar buttons, and the selected row carries a small open-record
affordance — a gesture nobody can see is not a discoverable action.

## Forms & Validation

### Minimise required fields

Only hard-require what is genuinely essential. Ask: "can the system function without this
right now?" If yes, make it optional. In this app almost nothing is truly required — a node
needs a type and a place in the tree; even the name can be filled in later.

### Allow partial saves

Let users save incomplete records. Forcing completeness produces junk data, lost work, and
abandonment — people frequently know a task exists before they know how long it will take.

### Use drawers for complex forms

For forms with many fields, conditional sections, or dropdowns needing room to expand, use
the drawer. Never cram them into grid cells.

### Inline validation

- Validate **on blur**, not while typing.
- Error messages must be **specific and actionable** — "Effort must look like 2 h, 45 min,
  or 3:45 h", not "Invalid input".
- Clear the error state as soon as the user corrects it.
- Keep **Save** available unless a submit is in progress; show blocking errors on the save
  attempt rather than disabling the button.
- Unparseable input in a grid cell **reverts to the stored value and flags the cell** rather
  than saving something wrong or silently clearing it.

## Decision Guide

| Question                                              | If yes →                       | If no →                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Is the field already a grid column?                   | Edit inline                    | Drawer                          |
| Is the value a rollup of descendants?                 | Read-only                      | Editable                        |
| Are there more than 3–4 fields to edit at once?       | Drawer (not modal, not inline) | Inline is fine                  |
| Does the form have distinct groups of fields?         | Tabs within the drawer         | A single scrolling pane         |
| Is this destructive or irreversible?                  | Confirmation dialog            | Just do it, with clear feedback |
| Does the user need the outline visible while editing? | Drawer                         | Drawer is still fine            |

## components/drawer-pattern

**Why it applies:** Appointment Information and Time Chart area editing use the same
right-sliding drawer pattern as node detail forms — guard content, dirty close, server
actions returning `{ ok, error }`, revalidate layout.

# Form Drawer Pattern

> For why we use drawers instead of modals, see `ux-principles.md`.

Editing a full record uses a **right-sliding drawer**, never a modal and never full-page
navigation. The outline stays visible behind it.

Adapted from the `wrcs/reactwrcs` standard of the same name. That version is written for MUI
and AG Grid (`<Drawer anchor="right">`, `ModalProps`, `sx`, `refreshData`); none of that
applies here. This project is Tailwind, React Server Components, and server actions — so the
**rules** carry over and the code does not.

## Structure

A drawer is a client component holding its own form state, rendered from the page shell:

```tsx
<Drawer open={open} onClose={close} labelledBy="node-form-title">
  {open && node && <NodeForm node={node} onSaved={close} />}
</Drawer>
```

## Rules

- **Guard the content**, not the container: `{open && node && ...}`. Never render a form
  before the record it edits is available.
- **Do not unmount the form on close** if the user might reopen it mid-edit. Where state
  must survive, lift it; where it must not, key the form on the node id so switching records
  resets it.
- **Width**: full-width on small screens, capped around `720px` on desktop
  (`w-full sm:w-[90%] md:max-w-[45rem]`).
- **Position below the app chrome** — the tab strip stays visible and clickable.
- **Escape closes**, a backdrop click closes, and focus is trapped inside while open. Return
  focus to the row that opened it.
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** — the slide transition is already disabled globally
  in `globals.css`, so don't reintroduce it inline.

## Open/close flow

1. **Edit** — set the selected node and open, together.
2. **Create** — clear the selected node and open, together.
3. **Close** — reset open, selected node, and dirty state in one action. Leaving any of the
   three behind is the source of most drawer bugs.

## Unsaved changes

If the form is dirty, closing prompts for confirmation. This is a destructive-confirmation
case under `ux-principles.md`, so a dialog is appropriate here.

## Saving

Drawer forms submit through **server actions**, following the pattern already established in
`src/app/outline/actions.ts`: the action returns `{ ok: false, error }` rather than throwing,
so a rejected save renders inline instead of crashing the view.

```tsx
const result = await saveNodeAction(values);
if (!result.ok) {
  setError(result.error); // check the error first
  return; // and stay open so the user can fix it
}
close(); // revalidatePath already refreshed the outline
```

Order matters: check the error, then close. Never close a drawer over a failed save — the
user's input disappears with it.

`revalidatePath` in the action refreshes the outline, so there is no separate refresh call
to make.

## Tabs inside the drawer

Group a record's fields into tabs when there are enough to warrant it, as Achieve does. On
save, run full validation across **every** tab and switch to the first tab containing an
error — never leave a user staring at a valid-looking tab wondering why save did nothing.
