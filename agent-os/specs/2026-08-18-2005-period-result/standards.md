## development/clean-code

# Clean code

Most of the code here is written by an agent and reviewed by one person in a hurry. That
changes what "clean" is for. It is not craftsmanship for its own sake — refactoring is
cheap now, so the old argument from cost is weaker. What is expensive is **review** and
**being wrong in a plausible-looking way**.

So the principles that survive are the ones that make code (a) easy to skim and trust in a
diff, and (b) safe for an agent to change one part of without breaking a distant part.
Names, small units, hard boundaries, boring consistency, and testability. Everything below
is one of those five wearing a different hat.

## The layers, and which way dependencies point

This is the highest-value rule in the file. It is what lets an agent work inside
`src/lib/fitness/` without touching the schedule.

```
src/app/**          routes, pages, and actions.ts — thin
  ↓
src/components/**   presentation and interaction
  ↓
src/lib/<domain>/   the real logic: pure modules, queries.ts, mutations.ts, types.ts
  ↓
src/db/             Drizzle schema and the client
```

Concretely:

- **`src/lib/**` never imports from `src/app/**`.** It does not know it is in a web app.
  It imports `@/components` only for a shared _type_ (a column shape), never a component.
- **Components never touch the database.** They may `import type` from `@/db/schema` and
  from a `mutations.ts` (a patch type is part of the contract), but the `db` client itself
  stops at `src/lib`. Components mutate by calling a server action.
- **`actions.ts` is a wrapper, not a place for logic.** It resolves the user, delegates to
  `src/lib`, revalidates, and shapes the result. `src/app/fitness/actions.ts` is the
  reference: one `run()` helper, one line per action. If an action grows a branch, the
  branch belongs in `src/lib`.
- **Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and scopes on it.** No exceptions,
  no ambient current-user lookup inside `src/lib`. See `development/testing.md` for why
  this is also a testing rule.

When a change wants to cross a layer the wrong way, that is the signal to stop and move
logic down, not to add an import.

## Names

Name the concept, not the mechanics. The file names in `src/lib/tree/` are the standard to
hold: `completionCascade.ts`, `shelving.ts`, `owningProject.ts`, `nextActions.ts`. Each one
tells you what domain question it answers before you open it.

- A module is named for the idea it owns, and its test is `<same>.test.ts` beside it.
- Functions read as what they return or do — `matchesFilter`, `flattenLevels`,
  `requireExercise`. `handle`, `process`, `doUpdate` are not names.
- Booleans read as assertions: `isShelved`, `hasChildren`.
- Say the unit when there is one: `weightLb`, `delaySeconds`, `dateKey` — never a bare
  `date` for something that is actually a calendar day string. See `development/dates.md`.
- Match the surrounding spelling, including the British `normalise`/`normaliseEquipment`
  already in `src/lib/fitness/`. Consistency beats your preference.

Good names are also the cheapest prompt engineering available: an agent continues the
patterns it can see, and ambiguous names are what make it invent a second, conflicting one.

## Small units, one reason to change

Pure logic goes in `src/lib/<domain>/` as a small module with a single job, and gets a
sibling test. `src/lib/fitness/` shows the grain: `plates.ts`, `bars.ts`, `restTimer.ts`,
`weightStep.ts` — each a concept, each a few dozen lines, each testable without a database
or a render.

- If a component holds a calculation, a comparison, or a rule with an edge case, that
  belongs in `src/lib`. The component keeps the wiring.
- If a function needs a comment to explain its second half, that half is a function.
- Split by _reason to change_, not by size. `queries.ts` and `mutations.ts` stay separate
  even when both are long, because they change for different reasons.

## Consistency over cleverness

There is one of each thing here. Use it; do not build a second one.

| Concern              | The one implementation                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tabular anything     | `DataGrid` (`src/components/grid/`) — see `components/data-grid.md`         |
| Centered dialog      | `ModalShell` (`src/components/detail/`) — see `components/modal-pattern.md` |
| Record editing       | `Drawer` + `DrawerFooter` — see `components/drawer-pattern.md`              |
| Views and commands   | the registries in `src/components/shell/` — see `components/navigation.md`  |
| Server action result | `run()` / `runQuery()` / `ActionResult` in `src/app/actionResult.ts`        |
| HTTP responses       | `{ ok, data }` / `{ ok, error }` — see `api/response-format.md`             |
| Calendar dates       | `fromDateKey` / `toDateKey` — see `development/dates.md`                    |

A second grid or a bespoke dialog is not a local decision; it is a permanent tax on every
future change and a fork in the pattern an agent will learn from. If the shared component
genuinely cannot do the job, extend the shared component.

The same holds inside a file: copy the error-handling, the import order, and the argument
order of the code next to it, even where you would have chosen differently on a blank page.

## Explicit over implicit; simple over general

- Make data flow visible. Prefer a passed argument to a context lookup, a returned value to
  a mutated parameter, one `if` to a lookup table of one entry.
- **No speculative generality.** Do not add an options object, a strategy parameter, or a
  `<T>` for a second caller that does not exist. When the second caller arrives, generalise
  then — the diff is small and the shape will be right, which it would not have been.
- Comments explain _why_, and are worth writing exactly where the reasoning is non-obvious:
  the header comment in `src/lib/fitness/mutations.ts` ("history rows never cascade from the
  outline") is the model. Comments that restate the code are noise that goes stale.
- Where a rule is deliberately not enforced, say so and say why — the
  `no-unnecessary-condition` note in `eslint.config.mjs` is the model. A future agent will
  otherwise "fix" it.

## Testability

Design so the tricky part can be tested without a browser: pure function in, value out.
That is the practical reason logic lives in `src/lib`. What to test and what to skip is
`development/testing.md` — do not duplicate it here.

## DRY, judiciously

Deduplicate a **business rule** — a rule that must change in one place or be wrong. Priority
ordering, shelving semantics, date encoding: one implementation, always.

Tolerate duplicate _shape_. Two components with similar JSX, two queries with a similar
`where`, are not a violation. Extracting them early produces an abstraction with a boolean
parameter, which is worse than the copy and harder to unpick later. Two occurrences is a
coincidence; three with the same reason to change is a pattern.

## When an agent writes it

- **Small, reviewable diffs.** A change that touches one domain folder gets read properly;
  a 40-file change gets skimmed and merged on faith.
- **Review agent output like a junior's:** run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and the
  typecheck, and read the diff. Confident, plausible, and wrong is the failure mode.
- **New abstractions, new dependencies, and new shared components need a reason stated in
  the PR or the spec.** Deleting a guard, a check, or a test to make something pass needs a
  louder one.
- **Load the relevant standards before writing** (`/inject-standards`). Stated constraints
  are what keep generated code inside the guardrails.
- Put human effort into the expensive parts — layer boundaries, the data model, the
  `userId` scoping, domain rules — and let the agent do the mechanical work inside them.

## development/testing

# Testing

This is a personal project with one developer and no users to page at 3am. Tests here are
not a quality ritual and not a coverage target — they are a **tripwire**. Their job is to
notice when something quietly stops working: a refactor that drops a `userId` from a
`where` clause, a date helper that shifts by an hour across DST, an agent that "fixes" a
bug by deleting the guard that caught it.

That purpose sets the bar. A test earns its place if it would **fail loudly on a plausible
mistake**. If breaking the code would not break the test, the test is decoration.

## What gets tested

**Pure logic in `src/lib/**` — always.** Recurrence expansion, sort keys, tree slicing,
date geometry, filters. These are cheap to test, hold the trickiest reasoning in the
codebase, and are exactly where a wrong answer looks plausible. Adjacent `foo.test.ts`.

**Database mutations and queries — always, as `*.integration.test.ts`.** Every one of these
takes a `userId` and is expected to scope by it. Prove it: a mutation suite is not done
until it has a case where **a second user tries to read, change, and delete the first
user's row and fails at every step**. A dropped `userId` is one of the easiest mistakes to
make and is completely invisible when you only ever test with one user.

**React components — no.** There is no testing-library setup and adding one is not
currently worth it. The bug class that actually bit this codebase in components was
unhandled promise rejections, and that is caught by the type-aware ESLint rules
(`no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`) far more cheaply than by rendering tests.
If a component grows real logic, extract it to `src/lib/**` and test it there.

**Server actions in `src/app/**/actions.ts` — no.** They are thin wrappers that resolve
the user and delegate. Test what they delegate to.

## What a good test looks like here

- **Name the invariant, not the mechanics.** `"does not let one user rename another's
chart"` survives a rewrite. `"calls db.update with the right args"` does not.
- **Pin behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong**, and say why in a comment when the
  expected value is non-obvious — DST boundaries, end-of-month clamping, inclusive vs
  exclusive range ends, "end after N occurrences" when the window starts later.
- **Prefer real values over mocks.** Integration tests use the real Postgres from
  `npm run db:up`, each under a freshly created user, cleaned up in `afterAll`. Do not mock
  Drizzle — a mocked query proves nothing about the query.
- **Cover the boundary, not every value.** One test for "interval 0 floors to 1" beats six
  tests for intervals 1 through 6.

## What not to write

- Snapshot tests. They pass whatever the code does, which is the opposite of a tripwire.
- Tests that restate the implementation line by line. When the code changes they change
  with it and never catch anything.
- Tests for framework or library behaviour. Drizzle and Vitest are already tested.
- Tests for trivial pass-throughs, getters, or type-only modules.

## When adding a feature

1. Put the real logic in `src/lib/**`, not in the component.
2. Write the pure tests alongside it. If the logic branches on dates, include a DST or
   month-boundary case. Calendar fixtures use **`fromDateKey("2026-08-01")`** and assert
   with **`toDateKey`** — never `new Date("2026-08-01")`, never `getHours() === 0` (stored
   as UTC noon). Keep the Aug 1→Jul 31 regression covered — see `development/dates.md`.
3. If it touches the database, add an `*.integration.test.ts` — including the cross-user
   case.
4. Run `npm test`. The pre-commit hook runs the unit tests and pre-push runs everything,
   but do not make the hook the first time you find out.

## Mechanics

|                        |                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit tests             | `foo.test.ts` beside `foo.ts`, no database, must stay hermetic    |
| Integration tests      | `foo.integration.test.ts`, real Postgres, one fresh user per test |
| Run everything         | `npm test`                                                        |
| Run only the fast ones | `npm run test:unit`                                               |

Integration tests **skip loudly** when Postgres is unreachable, so a stopped container
never blocks a commit — see `src/lib/testing/database.ts`. That means a green
`npm run test:unit` does **not** mean the database logic passed. Check for the skip
warning before trusting a green run on a change that touched `src/lib/**/mutations.ts` or
`queries.ts`.

## development/security

# Security

This file exists because real bank data landed in the app on 2026-08-12. The application
layer already scoped every finance read and write by `userId`; what it did not have was a
written rule for the next agent that touches auth, a mutation, or a header. The
hardening that prompted this file is
`agent-os/specs/2026-08-12-1316-security-hardening-and-standard/`.

## Per-user scoping is the core invariant

Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and **proves ownership before
writing**. An `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?` that matches nothing looks exactly
like a successful no-op, so a dropped `userId` is invisible unless something checks.
`requireTransaction` / `requireAccount` in `src/lib/finances/mutations.ts` are the
pattern: load the row scoped to the caller, throw if it is missing, then write.

A database test is not done until a second user has tried to read, change, and delete
the first user's row and failed at every step. That is also in
`development/testing.md`; it is restated here because it is a security rule that happens
to be enforced by tests, not a testing preference.

When you add a query module, register it in
`src/lib/db/crossUserReads.integration.test.ts`. That file is the repo-wide sweep for a
dropped `userId`. A new `listX` that only ever runs in a one-user test will not catch
itself.

## The auth gate is server-side; the proxy is not the gate

`src/proxy.ts` checks cookie _presence_ so guests never see the app chrome. The
authority is `getCurrentUserId()` inside each page and action, which validates the
session. That redundancy is the point. Next's middleware-bypass CVE class
(CVE-2025-29927) was a non-event here because a request that skipped the proxy still
had no session and no user.

Do not "simplify" this by making the proxy the only check. Do not narrow the matcher
to skip prefetches: that matcher is the auth gate as well as the header pass.

## Three identities stay separate

From `src/lib/auth/identity.ts`:

1. **Session user** — a human at `/login`.
2. **Dev user** — who the local bypass serves. Default `test@example.com`. Never an
   owner account by default.
3. **Agent user** — who a valid `PLANNER_AGENT_API_KEY` maps to. Required in
   production; no fallback to a real account.

These were one function until the local bypass started running as the account linked to
a real Google Calendar. Unconfigured defaults must resolve to a test address or throw,
never to real data. The two independent gates on the bypass itself are in
`src/lib/auth/dev-bypass.ts` — it is inert in a production build even if the env var
is set.

## Secrets

- Environment only. `.env*` is gitignored except `.env.example`.
- Fail closed when a required secret is unset. The agent Bearer key is the model:
  missing key → `internal`, not open access. See `api/agent-auth.md`.
- Timing-safe comparison for any shared secret, and hash first so length does not leak.
- Never log an `Authorization` header or a password.

## Errors: messages we wrote are user-facing; messages the database wrote are not

Deliberate throws (`new Error("Transaction not found.")`) are the inline validation the
drawers render. Driver errors are not. `postgres` quotes table, column, and constraint
names, and a constraint violation can quote the offending **row values** — which for
the finance tables is a bank description and an amount. Connection failures embed the
database host.

The tell is a `code` property, or `name === "PostgresError"`. Nothing this codebase
throws on purpose has a `code`. The check lives in `src/lib/security/safeError.ts` and
runs at every client boundary: `actionErrorMessage` in `src/app/actionResult.ts`, and
the import/export route catches. Log the real error before replacing it, or the next
Neon timeout becomes "Something went wrong." with no way to find out why.

Do not start a `UserFacingError` hierarchy to "do this properly." One hundred and fifty
deliberate sentences would have to be reclassified, and a missed one would become
"Something went wrong." The leak class that matters is the one nobody wrote.

## Headers and CSP

Static headers live in `next.config.ts`: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`. The Content-Security-Policy is **not** there —
it carries a per-request nonce, generated in `src/proxy.ts` and built by
`src/lib/security/csp.ts`.

The nonce must be set on the **request** and the **response**. Next.js extracts it by
parsing the CSP off the request, which is how framework and bundle script tags get it
without a single `<script>` being touched. Setting it only on the response ships a
policy whose nonce nothing on the page carries — a blank screen, not a soft failure.

Two constraints that will look like mistakes:

- **No nonce in `style-src`.** A nonce present in a directive makes the browser ignore
  `'unsafe-inline'` in that same directive. FullCalendar positions every event with an
  inline `style` attribute; a nonce here breaks the calendar while looking stricter.
- **`'unsafe-eval'` is development only.** React uses `eval` to rebuild server stacks
  in the browser. Neither React nor Next.js evals in a production build.
  `upgrade-insecure-requests` is production only for the same reason:
  `http://localhost:3047` must keep working.

**Do not set HSTS.** Vercel already sends
`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` on `.vercel.app`, and that domain is on
the browser preload list. A hand-rolled value would risk overriding a
preload-qualified one with a weaker one.

## Rate limiting

Better Auth's in-memory sign-in limit (3 per 10s) is adequate against a 36-character
password from a manager, with public sign-up disabled. Database-backed storage would
buy DoS/cost control at the price of a table and a write per auth request on Neon's
free tier.

Revisit when any of these become true: a second human user, public sign-up, or a
password that is not from a manager.

`minPasswordLength` is 16 in both `src/lib/auth/server.ts` and
`src/lib/auth/provision.ts`. The provision copy exists because a script that hashed a
short password would write a row Better Auth then refused to sign in.

## Dependencies

Patch `next` promptly — it is the runtime surface. Dev-only transitives
(`drizzle-kit`, `esbuild`, unused `sharp` via `next/image`) are low priority.
Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens the PRs weekly, grouped by
production/development minor+patch. Majors stay ungrouped so they get read.

## Markdown

`rehype-raw` stays out of `react-markdown`. Notes are a stored-XSS surface if HTML in
a note becomes executable. See `src/components/notes/MarkdownPreviewBody.tsx`.

## development/dates

# Date and time handling

This app is calendar-day heavy (plans, deadlines, shelves, day pages) with a smaller set
of true instants (created/updated, completion history, appointments). Getting the two kinds
mixed is how completed dates show as the wrong day after a save.

Domain meanings of the four node dates live in `product/date-model.md`. This file is the
**mechanics**: storage, keys, UI, and tests.

Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Drizzle + Postgres. No date-fns / Day.js / Luxon — keep
helpers in `src/lib/schedule/geometry.ts` and `src/lib/dateMath.ts`.

## Two kinds of value

| Kind             | Means                      | Examples                                                                                                            | Store / compare as                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calendar day** | A date with no time of day | deadline, deferred, target start/end, actual start, date completed, day page `day`, note date, all-day Google dates | **UTC noon** of that day in `timestamptz`; key via `toDateKey` |
| **Instant**      | A real moment in time      | `created_at`, `updated_at`, `nodes.completed_at`, `task_completions.completed_at`, timed appointments               | `timestamptz`; compare as instants                             |

Never use one kind’s helpers for the other.

## Why UTC noon (not local midnight)

**Regression this encoding exists to prevent (Lee, 2026-08):** set Date completed to
**Aug 1** → save → field showed **Jul 31**. Target start/deferred correctly went to Aug 8.

What happened:

1. Browser in US Eastern stored **local midnight** Aug 1 → `2026-08-01T04:00:00.000Z`
2. Server process in **UTC** ran `startOfDay` → `2026-08-01T00:00:00.000Z`
3. Browser read with **local** getters → evening of **Jul 31**

So calendar days are encoded as **UTC noon of the intended `YYYY-MM-DD`**. Then `toDateKey`
(UTC date components) returns the same key on every machine. Do **not** “fix” with
`startOfDay` on the server — that is process-local and reintroduces the bug.

“Is it still Tuesday **for me**?” is different — that uses **`localDateKey`** / `useToday`
(wall clock of an instant).

## Core rules

1. **Postgres timestamps are timezone-aware** (`timestamptz`).
2. **Every calendar-field write** goes through `fromDateKey` / `asCalendarDay` / `recordDate`
   (detail) — never raw `startOfDay`, never process-local midnight.
3. **Every calendar-field read** for display/compare uses `toDateKey` (UTC components of the
   stored encoding).
4. **Never `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`** (UTC midnight) and never process-local
   `new Date(y, m - 1, d)` in shared server/client code.
5. **Never `date.toISOString().slice(0, 10)` ad hoc** — call `toDateKey` or `localDateKey`.
6. **Bare `YYYY-MM-DD` strings** (day page URLs, day keys) are labels; shift with
   `shiftDateKey` / `daysBetweenKeys`.
7. **Instants stay instants** until display (`completedAt` history vs `dateCompleted` day).
8. **No business rule may depend on the server’s `TZ`.** Pass `today: string | null` into
   pure helpers. UI “today” is `localDateKey` on the client.

## Canonical helpers

| Need                           | Use                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Stored calendar Date → day key | `toDateKey` (UTC components)                           |
| Day key → stored Date          | `fromDateKey` (UTC noon)                               |
| Normalize any Date → calendar  | `asCalendarDay` (= `fromDateKey(toDateKey(…))`)        |
| Wall-clock day of an instant   | `localDateKey`                                         |
| “Today” in the UI              | `useToday()` → `localDateKey(new Date())` or `null`    |
| Add days then store calendar   | `asCalendarDay(addDays(…))` (see recurrence)           |
| Whole days between keys        | `daysBetweenKeys`                                      |
| Date input                     | `DateField` — `toDateKey` display, `fromDateKey` write |

`startOfDay` / `addDays` in `dateMath.ts` are **local wall-clock** helpers for appointment
_times_ and intermediate math. After stepping a **calendar** field, re-encode with
`asCalendarDay` before writing.

## Database

- Prefer `timestamptz` for every timestamp column.
- Calendar-day columns: only the date half is meaningful; writers store **UTC noon**.
- Instant columns store the true moment.
- Record dates (`actual_start_date`, `date_completed`): never in the future; clamp on write.
  See `product/date-model.md`.

## Forms and detail drawer

- `DateField` shows `toDateKey(value)` and writes `fromDateKey(picked)`.
- Plan dates on `nodes` (deadline, deferred, target start/end) are re-encoded with
  `asCalendarDay` on save.
- **Record** fields: `max={localDateKey(new Date())}`; server uses `recordDate`.
- Completing a task stamps `date_completed` with `asCalendarDay(at)`, not `startOfDay(at)`.
  Recurrence moves plan dates with `asCalendarDay` after `addDays`.

## Display and grids

- Grid date columns: `toDateKey(date)`.
- Overdue / “today” comparisons: field’s `toDateKey` vs `useToday()` (`localDateKey`).
- Standalone exact values (grid cells, compact rows, filter labels, linked-record dates):
  format the canonical key through `useDateFormatter()` in components, or pass the user's
  `DateFormatId` into pure `src/lib/**` helpers. The Achieve-compatible default is
  `M/D/YYYY`.
- `formatDateKey` reads written `YYYY-MM-DD` components and uses a closed English preset
  catalogue. It never parses the key as an instant and invalid keys render blank.
- Formatting is presentation only. Sorting, filtering, comparisons, native date inputs,
  route keys, and stored values remain canonical `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Long values keep their existing column tracks and truncate with a full-date tooltip.
  Partial formats also expose the full date on hover.
- Contextual calendar labels keep their own purpose-specific format: day and week headings,
  ranges, mini-month labels, chart axes, timestamps, and planning prose do not follow the
  standalone preference.

## Testing (required regressions)

Calendar fixtures: `fromDateKey("2026-08-01")`. Assert with `toDateKey`. Do **not** assert
`getHours() === 0` (values are UTC noon).

**The suite runs in a pinned zone** — `TZ: "America/New_York"` in `vitest.config.ts`. Some
tests are _about_ local wall clock (the DST spring-forward in `recurrence.test.ts`, the
Aug 1 → Jul 31 story below) and only mean anything in a named zone; the rest must not care.
That is the point of the pin: a test that changes its answer with the machine's zone is
either testing the wrong thing or using a local-midnight fixture where the standard above
says `fromDateKey`. Do not remove it to "fix" a failure — the pin is what makes CI, a Vercel
build (UTC) and a laptop agree.

Must keep green:

1. **Round-trip:** `toDateKey(fromDateKey(k)) === k` for several keys.
2. **Aug 1 / Jul 31:** encoding survives “server UTC + client Eastern” story (see
   `geometry.test.ts` and detail mutation integration tests).
3. **Complete-via-date + regenerate:** complete on day D → `dateCompleted` key is D, deferred
   / target start are D+interval (not D−1).

## database/migrations

# Migrations

Drizzle, `drizzle/` for the SQL, `drizzle/meta/` for the snapshots it diffs against.

## Changing the schema

```sh
# 1. edit src/db/schema.ts
npm run db:generate     # writes drizzle/NNNN_name.sql + meta/NNNN_snapshot.json + journal entry
# 2. read the generated SQL before trusting it
npm run db:migrate      # applies it locally
```

Commit the **`.sql`, the snapshot, and the `_journal.json` entry together**. They are one
change; a commit with two of the three is the bug described below.

## Never hand-write a migration without its snapshot

`db:generate` diffs the _last snapshot_ against `schema.ts`. Drop one and the next generate
diffs from a stale baseline, emits SQL that re-creates things that already exist, and has to
be hand-written too — which drops another snapshot. **One omission poisons every migration
after it.**

That is not hypothetical: `0004` (commit `566a565`) shipped a `.sql` and a journal entry
with no snapshot, `0005`–`0008` were then all hand-written, and `db:generate` was unusable
for five migrations. `0007` made it worse by adding a snapshot that was the `0003` schema
re-stamped with new ids — a _wrong_ snapshot is worse than a missing one, because drizzle
believes it.

If you genuinely must hand-write SQL that `generate` cannot express (a backfill, a
data-preserving column swap), still regenerate the snapshot afterwards so the chain stays
intact.

**Current state:** repaired as of `0008`. Snapshots `0004`–`0006` are absent and `0007` is
wrong; they are left as history. Only the newest snapshot matters for diffing, and that one
is correct — `db:generate` works and reports "No schema changes" against a clean tree.

## Hand-written SQL, when unavoidable

Statements are separated by a breakpoint marker, and a column swap keeps the data:

```sql
ALTER TABLE "appointments" ADD COLUMN "check_state" "appointment_check" DEFAULT 'open' NOT NULL;--> statement-breakpoint
UPDATE "appointments" SET "check_state" = CASE WHEN "completed" THEN 'done'::"appointment_check" ELSE 'open'::"appointment_check" END;--> statement-breakpoint
ALTER TABLE "appointments" DROP COLUMN "completed";
```

Add the column, backfill it, then drop the old one — never drop first.

## Connections

Migrations run over **`DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`**, never the pooler
(`drizzle.config.ts` falls back to `DATABASE_URL`). Neon's pooled endpoint is
transaction-mode, where DDL like `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` fails with an unhelpful error.
Locally the two are the same string.

## Production

`npm run build` runs `scripts/migrate-on-deploy.mjs` before `next build`, so schema and code
ship together — a past deploy shipped code querying tables Neon did not have yet.

It is gated hard on `VERCEL_ENV === "production"`. **Preview deployments share the one Neon
database**; without the gate, a push to any branch could reshape production's schema. A
failed migration fails the build rather than deploying code whose tables do not exist.

## `db:push` — local scratch only

`db:push` writes `schema.ts` straight to a database and produces **no migration file**, so
the files and the database silently diverge. Fine for trying a shape on your own Docker
Postgres; never against Neon, and never as the thing that ships. The change is not real
until `db:generate` has produced a migration.

## `db:seed` is destructive

It **deletes the dev user's nodes, appointments and time charts** before inserting. Never
run it to refresh a database someone is using. To exercise it, point it at a scratch
database — an exported `DATABASE_URL` beats `--env-file`:

```sh
docker exec planner-postgres psql -U planner -d postgres -c 'CREATE DATABASE planner_seedcheck'
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://planner:planner@localhost:5432/planner_seedcheck"
npx drizzle-kit migrate && npm run db:seed
```

## components/navigation

# Navigation & Commands

> For the philosophy these rules serve, see `ux-principles.md`. For how each surface
> reshapes below the breakpoint, see `responsive.md`.

Achieve Planner reached all sixteen of its views through the **Go** menu, and kept only the
ones you had opened as tabs. We inherited the tabs without the Go menu, so every view had to
be a permanent tab and the eleventh was already too many.

Six surfaces now, each answering a different question.

| Surface                    | Question it answers              | Role                                                 | Where                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Sidebar**                | "Where can I go?"                | Visual catalog of destinations. Commands… opens `⌘K` | Desktop, always                        |
| **Menu bar**               | "What can I do here?"            | **Complete catalog of commands**                     | Application chrome, above the page bar |
| **Page bar**               | "Where else can I go _in here_?" | Destinations inside this module                      | Below the menu, above page toolbars    |
| **Commands panel**         | "…show me all of it at once"     | The same tree left open                              | Desktop, opt-in, remembered            |
| **Row context menu**       | "What can I do to _this_ row?"   | Narrow, row-scoped subset                            | Right-click / long-press a row         |
| **Command palette** (`⌘K`) | "What can this app do?"          | Searchable overlay + Go-to extras                    | Desktop, on demand                     |

The menu bar is the **source of truth for completeness**. Toolbars and the Commands panel / palette are accelerators. A user who never opens `⌘K` must still be able to find every command by reading the menus.

**Panel vs palette.** Complementary accelerators of the same catalog, not two versions of
one control. The panel is the menu tree left open — spatial, hierarchical, no typing. The
palette is the only command-search surface (`⌘K`, View ▸ Command palette, and the sidebar
**Commands…** row, which teaches the chord rather than implementing a second search). Do
**not** add a filter box to the panel: that would make the two compete, and the panel's value
is that the organization stays visible.

That row was labelled `Search…` until **Find** joined the rail beneath it. Two rows promising
to search — one reaching commands, one reaching records — is the ambiguity this whole table
exists to prevent, and the row's own tooltip already said "commands" while its label did not.
**Searching commands and searching content are different questions and get different
surfaces**: `⌘K` for what the app can do, `/find` for what is written in it. Neither grows
into the other. Nested families stay expanded as headed groups in the
panel; folding is for the menu bar and the row menu, where space is scarce.

Below `md` the sidebar is replaced by the bottom nav plus the More sheet, there is no palette and
no desktop menu bar, and no panel — **`⋯` becomes the menu bar**, rendering the same tree with the
section names as headings. It is **shell-owned**, so a destination without a page toolbar still
has it. See `responsive.md`.

Achieve had four of these six (menu bar, icon toolbars, the docked **Outline Commands** pane, and
a sectioned row menu), all reading one command set. The palette is ours; the point of the others is
that they were right.

## Modules live in one registry

`src/components/shell/modules.ts` is the only list of modules. It is read by the sidebar, the
phone bottom nav, the More sheet, the phone header's "you are here" title, and the palette's
go-to entries.

**Never hard-code a module anywhere else.** Five surfaces reading one array is what stops the
phone and the desktop from disagreeing about what the app contains — the previous version of
this file was four surfaces reading `TABS`, and that was already the reason it worked.

The rule has already been broken once, quietly: `MobileNav` wrote out its three hrefs while this
section listed it among the readers. It went unnoticed until Tasks became a page and `/tasks`
stopped being a destination at all. **A surface that hard-codes agrees with the registry right
up until the registry changes**, which is the only moment the rule was for.

### The list is flat

There are no sections. Modules were grouped under `Plan` / `Do` / `Track` / `Library` while
there were fifteen of them, and nine turned out to be pages: seven Plan modules that were one
`loadOutline` drawn seven ways, plus Contacts and Resources. Eight rows do not need headings,
and `Plan` and `Library` would each have been a heading over one row of the same name — the
chrome-that-teaches-nothing the page bar's two-page floor rejects one tier down.

If the sidebar grows back past a dozen, grouping returns as a field and a `groupBy`. It is not
a decision that needs defending in advance, which is why the `section` field went rather than
being kept warm.

### Reserved modules

A module we have decided the home of but not built is marked `status: "reserved"`. It renders
nowhere and is not a navigation target.

- **Do** add the entry as soon as the module is decided on. It costs a line and it stops the
  next person re-arguing navigation.
- **Do not** render a reserved module as a disabled or "coming soon" entry. A menu full of dead
  rows teaches the reader to stop reading the menu, and then the live rows stop working too.

### The phone's primary destinations are a registry list, and one of them is a page

`PRIMARY_DESTINATIONS` in `modules.ts` holds the bottom bar's three slots in order, each naming
a module and _optionally_ a page. `primaryDestinations()` resolves each to an `href` and an
`isActive(pathname)` predicate.

This replaced a `primary: boolean` on the module entry, and the reason is worth keeping: **a
flag can only point at a module.** The Tasks slot has to open `/plan/tasks`, and a module-level
`primary` would send it to `/plan`, which resolves to `lastPage` — a button labelled Tasks
opening Goals. The predicate is the other half: comparing module ids would light Tasks on all
seven Plan pages.

Icons live with this list rather than in `pages.ts`, which stays React-free so it can be
unit-tested. That split is why the two registries exist at different altitudes at all.

## Pages live in one registry too

Three words, three different things, and they are not interchangeable:

| Word       | Means                                                    | Registry                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Module** | A sidebar destination — Plan, Fitness, Schedule          | `shell/modules.ts`        |
| **Page**   | A destination _within_ a module — Tasks, Journal, Agenda | `lib/navigation/pages.ts` |
| **View**   | A saved collection of filter / column / sort settings    | `lib/settings/views.ts`   |

Tasks moved from the first row to the second when the consolidation ran, which is the useful
thing about the example: **the tier a destination belongs to is a fact about the data behind
it, not about how important it is.** Seven grids over one `loadOutline` are seven pages no
matter how much time you spend in them.

A fourth word, **pane**, is a layout region that collapses below `md` (Day's appointments /
list / journal). It is responsive layout, not navigation, and does not belong in any registry.

**"Lens" names exactly one thing: `TabToolbar`'s second row.** It is a useful name for the row
that answers "what am I looking at" — view picker, search, filter, grouping, density — and it
stops being useful the moment an individual control is also called a lens, which is how two
separate page switchers came to be documented as "lens controls" while sitting one tier above
everything else on that row. The row is the lens; the things on it have their own names.

**View is not renamed.** It is Achieve's own word for a saved column/filter preset, it is in
`data-grid.md` and every grid call site, and "lens" as a synonym for it buys nothing.

`pages.ts` is keyed by module id and holds no icons — the bar is text — which is what lets it
live in `src/lib` and be tested. `modules.ts` owns the accessors (`modulePages`,
`moduleHasPageBar`, `moduleDefaultPageHref`) and asserts at compile time that every id keying
the page registry is a real module.

**Everything the module registry promises, the page registry promises.** One list, read by the
bar, the palette's go-to entries and the bare-path redirect. `status: "reserved"` means renders
nowhere and is not a target. A reserved page is not drawn as a disabled tab.

### The control depends on the question, not the module

> **Underline tabs are navigation. Bordered segments are a setting with two or three values.**

This is the whole rule, and it was written after four modules answered "how do I reach the other
thing in here" four different ways: Fitness with a bordered segment in one style, Schedule and
Notes with a bordered segment in another, Day with a bare pair of links. Consistency here does
**not** mean one control for every switcher — that is exactly how `Sessions | Exercises` came to
look like a density picker. It means one control per question, drawn identically everywhere.

Density keeps its bordered segment. Every navigation switcher is a tab.

### The bar gets its own row, and only when it earns one

Four tiers, in this order, even though this is a hybrid web app with a sidebar:

1. **Application menu** — File / New / Item / Organize / View / Tools. Belongs to the app.
2. **Page bar** — sibling destinations inside this module. Belongs to the module.
3. **Page verb row** — icon buttons and the selection chip. “What can I _do_?” Belongs to
   the page.
4. **Lens row** — view picker, search, `Filter…`, `Group by`, density. “How am I _looking_
   at it?” Belongs to the grid, so it sits **immediately above the data**.

Achieve put a Win32 toolbar directly under the menus. We do not copy that. The verb row is
the page's actions; the lens changes what the grid shows, and proximity is the rule that
wins: cause sits next to effect. Reversing them to look more like 2005, or folding both
into one strip because “the desktop app had one toolbar,” is the mistake these rows exist
to prevent. A single combined strip is allowed only when both sets are short; the moment
verbs or lens controls fill the width, they stay two rows, verbs above, lens on the data.

On a dual-grid page the verb row stays page-level. Each grid keeps (or shares) a lens that
is visibly about that grid. Selection-specific verbs grow on the verb row so they do not
push Filter / Group / Search farther from the rows they affect.

Not folded into the command row: navigation sits at the rank of the sidebar, and putting it
among the verbs is the flattening `TabToolbar`'s two-row split already exists to prevent, one
tier up. Putting the page bar **above** the menu is the other inversion: the menu then reads as
belonging to the current tab, and it jumps when you switch pages.

It renders **only at two or more built pages**. A single tab spends a row saying "you are in the
only place there is", so modules with one destination pay nothing.

Below `md` the page bar is the row that survives. The desktop menu is hidden down there, so the
bar is the _only_ path to a sibling page: it scrolls sideways and its tabs are 44px. `⋯` is the
phone's menu, on the shell.

### A page is a URL

Real `<Link>`s to real routes, so Back works, reload holds, and a page opens in a new tab. Two
of these were persisted settings that never touched the address bar, and promoting them cost
nothing: the stickiness that motivated the setting is preserved separately by the bare module
path redirecting to `shell.lastPage`.

The query string is carried across a page switch, because the query is _where you are looking_
and the page is _how it is drawn_ — flipping Calendar → Agenda must not discard the week you
scrolled to. Each page validates its own params, so one the destination cannot use is ignored.

### A focused flow is not a page

`/schedule/plan`, `/fitness/log`, `/schedule/time-chart/[id]` and the editors never appear in
the bar, and they suppress the application menu. The test: **in the bar you leave by tapping a
sibling; a focused flow has an exit.**

This is enforced by how the active page is resolved, and the rule is neither of the two you
would reach for first. **A declared segment matches its own subtree; anything undeclared matches
nothing.**

- `/fitness/sessions/abc` is the session editor, rendered _inside_ the Sessions page. Exact
  matching would drop the bar and the editor would look like it had left the module.
- `/schedule/time-chart/abc` is a focused flow. "First segment after the module" would invent a
  page for it.

Both wrong answers fail silently on a real route, which is why `pageForPathname` is tested and
the bar is not.

**The worked example lives in Schedule and is one letter wide.** The Time Charts list is the
page `/schedule/time-charts`; the editor is the focused flow `/schedule/time-chart/[chartId]`.
The list moved into Schedule and the editor deliberately did not move with it, because a
declared segment owns its subtree — `/schedule/time-charts/abc` would resolve to the page and
put the bar on an editor that already has its own exit. Anyone tidying the singular into the
plural is removing the mechanism, and `pages.test.ts` asserts both halves so they find out.

## Commands live in one registry

`src/lib/commands/registry.ts` defines what a command is. A module publishes its own with
`useRegisterCommands` and every renderer reads them through `useCommands`.

**One registry, every renderer.** A command described in two places is a command whose two
descriptions eventually disagree about whether it is available, what it is called, or which key
fires it. All three have happened here: eight views hand-wrote their row menus and one said
`Open record` where its own toolbar said `Open`; the Notes grid printed `Ctrl+Insert` and
`Shift+Tab` where the rest of the app printed `⌃Insert` and `⇧Tab`.

### A command declares its own placement

`menu`, `section`, `icon`, and optionally `toolbar` (a weight, meaning "also give me an icon
button") and `rowMenu`. `src/lib/commands/menus.ts` turns those into the menu tree, the icon row,
and the row menu.

Placement belongs to the **command**, never to the surface. A surface that filtered the list
itself would be a second placement rule, in a second file, that has to agree with the first — which
is what the Outline's twelve-id row-menu allowlist was, a thousand lines from the command it was
filtering.

`MENU_SECTIONS` is the declared section order per menu. It is a table rather than "whatever order
the commands were built in", because build order is an accident of which hook ran first and a menu
whose rows move between views is a menu you re-read every time.

### A command declares its own binding

`bindings`, and the printed shortcut is **derived** from it (`formatBinding`). There is one
`document` listener for all of them (`CommandKeys`), not one per view.

`Command.shortcut` used to be a string typed beside the label while the key that fired it lived in
a `switch` in whichever view owned a listener — eleven of them. Nothing in the app connected `"⌥↑"`
to `event.altKey && event.key === "ArrowUp"`, so a menu could promise a chord for years after the
handler stopped accepting it.

**Selection movement is not a command.** Arrow keys and shift-extend walk a row set; they have no
label, no menu row and no icon, and they stay in the view that owns the selection. If it belongs in
a menu it gets a binding; if it does not, it does not.

### Menus are the source of truth

`ux-principles.md`: _a gesture nobody can see is not a discoverable action_ — and there is no
`⌘K` on a phone. Every command must have a visible, tappable path.

**A command without `menu` is not shipped.** That is the rule that makes the palette and the
icon row legal. Adding a command to `⌘K` or to a toolbar alone is shipping it for the person
who already knew it was there.

The one exception is `group: "go"` — destinations. Their visual catalog is the **sidebar**
(and the page bar inside a module). The palette lists them as extras so typing `agenda` still
works. They do not get a Go menu. App-wide verbs (capture, Process Inbox, Plan Week, Settings,
Sign out) are **not** this exception; they live in **File**.

**A destination may carry a chord**, and exactly one does: `⇧⌘F` for Find, declared on the
generated `go.find` in `globalCommands.ts` beside quick capture's, so every surface prints the
same binding. It is not a second placement rule — the sidebar is still Find's catalog. It
earns a key because it is reached from the middle of other work, which is not true of a
destination you navigate to deliberately. Achieve put Advanced Find on **Edit**; we have no
Edit menu (`menu-completeness`), and Find is a place you go and come back to rather than a
verb applied to what is in front of you, so it is a destination.

### The menu belongs to the application, not the tab

The menu bar is not another toolbar. It is the application-level command catalog. `AppShell`
draws it, above the page bar, from `useCommands()`. File is always there. New / Item /
Organize / View / Tools appear when the destination has something for them.

That placement is load-bearing even though the rest of the chrome is modern (sidebar, page
tabs, local toolbars):

- The menu does not belong to the current tab, so it does not jump when the page bar changes.
- A destination that is merely simple — Insights, Dashboard, Overview, Journal — still has
  it. A page without a menu forces people into a toolbar or `⌘K`, which is the
  discoverability failure the catalog rule exists to prevent.
- Icon buttons, the selection chip, and the lens stay on the page, next to the data. Those
  are accelerators. They are never the only path.

**Focused flows may suppress the menu.** Weekly wizard (`/schedule/plan`), `/fitness/log`,
the time-chart editor, and the fitness session/exercise editors have their own exit and are
not destinations. Settings stays outside `AppShell`. Detect those flows with a pure path
helper next to `pageForPathname`. Do **not** treat "no page bar" as the signal — Chooser and
Metrics have no page bar and still need File.

### Targeting when two grids share a page

Command ids are unique across the merged catalog. Two toolbars both publishing `view.filter`
is last-wins, which silently filters only the grid that mounted second.

Each grid gets a stable `CommandScope` (`id` + label) from `src/lib/commands/scope.ts`. The
View menu (and `⌘K`) then carries both:

- A **focused shortcut** — `Filter…`, `Clear filters` — acting on the last-interacted grid
  (default: the top one). A visible focus ring makes "current grid" real.
- **Explicit per-grid rows** — `Filter for Subscriptions & bills…`, `Clear filters for
Recurring spend` — so the user can target a grid without focusing it first.

One grid: only the unscoped rows. Do not invent `Filter for Tasks…` on a page that has one
grid. Compact and flat: no extra "Top grid" submenu. The same commands appear in the palette
with the grid name in the label.

The lens `Filter…` button still opens **that** grid's panel only. `Clear filters` is a menu
and palette command, disabled with the specific reason when nothing is filtered. It is not a
toolbar button — `data-grid.md`.

### Complete everywhere, sectioned everywhere

Every surface lists everything it is responsible for, and **sections** are what keep that
readable. "Short" was the old answer and it was the wrong one: the `⋯` menu was kept short by
leaving things out and unsorted, which is how it ended up as a traditional app menu with the
organization removed.

- The **menu bar is the complete catalog**, drawn by the shell above the page bar. File is
  leftmost and always present. New / Item / Organize / View / Tools appear when the
  destination has something for them. A command that is not in a menu does not exist to
  anyone not already holding `⌘K`.
- The **toolbar is a subset.** `toolbar` is a weight meaning "also an icon button." Every
  toolbar item must also be a menu command, because that row is hidden below `md`. Frequency
  and immediacy, not completeness.
- The **Commands panel is the same tree left open.** Same labels, same sections, same
  disabled reasons. Nested families stay expanded as headed groups — folding is a menu-bar
  and row-menu concern. It is not a search surface. Register File and the named menus at the
  shell — a File menu that exists only as a `CommandBar` prop is invisible to the panel, to
  `⋯`, and to any destination that never mounts a `CommandBar`.
- The **palette lists every menu command, plus Go-to.** Shortcuts and icons are printed.
  **View ▸ Command palette** and the sidebar Search… row are the discoverable invocations;
  do not rely on people already knowing `⌘K`.
- The **row menu is the one narrow surface**, because it is about one row. A command opts in
  with `rowMenu`, and it is the same command with the same label — not a hand-written
  near-copy.

The same command has the same name, icon, and resulting action on every surface.

`ownControl: true` is the one exclusion, and it means something narrow: a _non-command widget_ on
the lens row already controls this (`Filter…`, `Group by`, density). `⋯` skips those and only
those, because on a phone that widget is the thing still on screen. Commands promoted to the
desktop icon row are **not** skipped — that row does not exist down there, so `⋯` is the only place
they live.

### Unavailable is not absent

A command that cannot run right now — nothing selected, no groups to collapse — is
`disabled`, not filtered out, with `title` saying why. A command that vanishes teaches you it
does not exist; a greyed one with "Select a row first" teaches you how to use it.

**The reason has to be the specific one.** "Paste" greyed with no `title` is indistinguishable
from a broken menu, and there are five separate reasons a paste can be refused. Where a helper
computes the refusal, it returns _the sentence_, not a boolean — `pasteRefusal` and
`GridSelectionCapability.moveReason` are both that shape, and both exist because the generic
sentence sent people looking at the wrong thing.

### A family folds behind one row

A section named in `NESTED_SECTIONS` renders as a single row with a fly-out (desktop) or a
drill-in with a Back row (touch), on **every** surface that shows it — the row menu and the menu
bar alike. Nesting a family on one and not the other is two shapes for one thing.

Which families fold is declared, not derived from how many rows they happen to have: `Convert to`
has five entries on the Outline and two on a flat grid, and a length rule would nest it in one
view and not the next. The single length condition is a floor of **two** — a fly-out onto one row
is a hover you have to perform to learn there was nothing behind it.

Fold the families where the _name_ is the useful thing and the members are a value picker: which
kind, which letter, which state, which level. Do **not** fold the verbs someone opened the menu
for. `Item`, `Move` and `Danger` stay flat, because burying `Delete` one hover deep is hiding it
rather than organizing it.

### Right-click reaches more than rows

Three targets, all built from `Command`s and rendered by `menuItemsFor`:

| Target                             | Menu                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A row**                          | `rowMenuFor(capabilities)` — the registry's `rowMenu` commands, for the row under the pointer |
| **Blank grid space**               | The same menu with **no selection**: item verbs greyed with their reason, creation live       |
| **A calendar slot or appointment** | The week's own verbs, resolved by hit-testing the point                                       |

The blank-area menu is deliberately not a second, shorter list. It is the row menu with `rowId`
`null`, which is why it cannot drift from the row menu — and why `New` is on the row menu at all:
without one live command, right-clicking an empty grid opens a menu of dead entries.

A menu is **rebuilt on open**, never read from the registered command list. Right-clicking an
unselected row selects it in the same event, so the registration still describes the previous
selection at the moment the menu appears.

### Plural where the verb is plural

Delete, the state changes and Cut act on the whole selection and print its size (`Delete (3)`).
Open, Rename, Indent, Outdent and Convert stay singular — opening three drawers is not a thing.

Two things must hold before a command may act on a selection, and neither is free:

1. **The selection is the rows on screen.** `DataGrid` reports them (`onNavigableIdsChange`); a
   host must not derive them from the rows it passed _in_, which is the list before the grid's
   own filters and search narrow it.
2. **The list is reduced to roots** (`selectionMoveRoots`). A child selected alongside its parent
   is already inside that parent's branch; acting on both does it twice and counts it twice.

### Where a control belongs

Three tiers, and a control should sit in the lowest one that still works. The menu tier is
the **catalog**, not a junk drawer for things you could not justify on the bar:

| Tier                | For                                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On the bar**      | Used most sessions. An icon button (`toolbar`), or a widget on the lens row      |
| **In a named menu** | Every real command. Occasional ones live _only_ here (`Show Fields`, the zooms)  |
| **Palette only**    | Nothing except `group: "go"` destinations (sidebar is their catalog). See above. |

`data-grid.md`'s toolbar tests still apply first: a control that is a column filter wearing a
checkbox, or whose only two states are "unavailable" and "duplicated", does not belong in any
of the three tiers — it belongs deleted.

## Shell state is a setting, not a `localStorage` flag

The sidebar's collapsed state and the Commands panel's open/collapsed state live in
`user_settings` under the `shell` scope, because they are the first things painted. Settings load server-side in `src/app/layout.tsx` precisely so a
stored preference arrives in the first HTML; a rail that renders expanded and then snaps shut
on every navigation is the most visible possible version of the flash that decision exists to
prevent.

Anything else the shell remembers goes in the same scope, and its parser must return defaults
for an unusable blob rather than throwing. It runs before the first paint: an exception there
does not break one grid, it breaks the app.

## Events, not a provider, for "open this"

The palette and the capture dialog own their own open state. The buttons that open them are
siblings, not descendants, so they dispatch a `window` event (`shell/commandEvent.ts`,
`capture/event.ts`) rather than forcing a provider into the root layout — which would also
hand the surface to `/login`, where it does not belong.

The keyboard shortcut is _not_ a dispatch of that event. `⌘K` and `c` are document listeners
inside their own components, because they need the `isTypingTarget` and `isModalOpen` guards
from `src/lib/keyboard.ts`, and those belong with the component that knows what it is doing.

## Testing

The registry's matching and merging, the menu tree (`menus.ts`), the binding match/format
(`bindings.ts`) and the shell settings codec are pure and live in `src/lib/` with tests. The
sidebar, menu bar, panel, palette, provider and overflow button are wiring and get none —
`testing.md`. Verify them in a real browser via the `run-planner` skill.

Two of those tests exist because the mistake is invisible otherwise:

- **`formatBinding` over the whole printed vocabulary.** These strings are on screen in menus, the
  panel, the palette and the outline hint bar, so a change to them should have to be deliberate.
- **`matchBinding` matches modifiers exactly.** `Insert`, `⇧Insert` and `⌃Insert` are three
  different commands. A binding that ignored the modifiers it did not name would make plain
  `Insert` fire on all three, and which one won would depend on dispatch order.

One runtime guard is load-bearing: `useRegisterCommands` re-registers on array identity, and
registering sets provider state. Anything in a command list's dependencies must be
identity-stable — a `useCallback` returned from a hook, not a bare arrow. Its dev churn detector
has caught this twice, most recently on the Commands panel's own `setOpen`.
