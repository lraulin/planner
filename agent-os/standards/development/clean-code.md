# Clean code

Most of the code here is written by an agent and reviewed by one person in a hurry. That
changes what "clean" is for. It is not craftsmanship for its own sake — refactoring is
cheap now, so the old argument from cost is weaker. What is expensive is **review** and
**being wrong in a plausible-looking way**.

So the principles that survive are the ones that make code (a) easy to skim and trust in a
diff, and (b) safe for an agent to change one part of without breaking a distant part.
Names, small units, hard boundaries, boring consistency, and testability. Everything below
is one of those five wearing a different hat.

## The layers, and which way dependencies point

This is the highest-value rule in the file. It is what lets an agent work inside
`src/lib/fitness/` without touching the schedule.

```
src/app/**          routes, pages, and actions.ts — thin
  ↓
src/components/**   presentation and interaction
  ↓
src/lib/<domain>/   the real logic: pure modules, queries.ts, mutations.ts, types.ts
  ↓
src/db/             Drizzle schema and the client
```

Concretely:

- **`src/lib/**` never imports from `src/app/**`.** It does not know it is in a web app.
  It imports `@/components` only for a shared _type_ (a column shape), never a component.
- **Components never touch the database.** They may `import type` from `@/db/schema` and
  from a `mutations.ts` (a patch type is part of the contract), but the `db` client itself
  stops at `src/lib`. Components mutate by calling a server action.
- **`actions.ts` is a wrapper, not a place for logic.** It resolves the user, delegates to
  `src/lib`, revalidates, and shapes the result. `src/app/fitness/actions.ts` is the
  reference: one `run()` helper, one line per action. If an action grows a branch, the
  branch belongs in `src/lib`.
- **Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and scopes on it.** No exceptions,
  no ambient current-user lookup inside `src/lib`. See `development/testing.md` for why
  this is also a testing rule.

When a change wants to cross a layer the wrong way, that is the signal to stop and move
logic down, not to add an import.

## Names

Name the concept, not the mechanics. The file names in `src/lib/tree/` are the standard to
hold: `completionCascade.ts`, `shelving.ts`, `owningProject.ts`, `nextActions.ts`. Each one
tells you what domain question it answers before you open it.

- A module is named for the idea it owns, and its test is `<same>.test.ts` beside it.
- Functions read as what they return or do — `matchesFilter`, `flattenLevels`,
  `requireExercise`. `handle`, `process`, `doUpdate` are not names.
- Booleans read as assertions: `isShelved`, `hasChildren`.
- Say the unit when there is one: `weightLb`, `delaySeconds`, `dateKey` — never a bare
  `date` for something that is actually a calendar day string. See `development/dates.md`.
- Match the surrounding spelling, including the British `normalise`/`normaliseEquipment`
  already in `src/lib/fitness/`. Consistency beats your preference.

Good names are also the cheapest prompt engineering available: an agent continues the
patterns it can see, and ambiguous names are what make it invent a second, conflicting one.

## Small units, one reason to change

Pure logic goes in `src/lib/<domain>/` as a small module with a single job, and gets a
sibling test. `src/lib/fitness/` shows the grain: `plates.ts`, `bars.ts`, `restTimer.ts`,
`weightStep.ts` — each a concept, each a few dozen lines, each testable without a database
or a render.

- If a component holds a calculation, a comparison, or a rule with an edge case, that
  belongs in `src/lib`. The component keeps the wiring.
- If a function needs a comment to explain its second half, that half is a function.
- Split by _reason to change_, not by size. `queries.ts` and `mutations.ts` stay separate
  even when both are long, because they change for different reasons.

## Consistency over cleverness

There is one of each thing here. Use it; do not build a second one.

| Concern              | The one implementation                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tabular anything     | `DataGrid` (`src/components/grid/`) — see `components/data-grid.md`         |
| Centered dialog      | `ModalShell` (`src/components/detail/`) — see `components/modal-pattern.md` |
| Record editing       | `Drawer` + `DrawerFooter` — see `components/drawer-pattern.md`              |
| Views and commands   | the registries in `src/components/shell/` — see `components/navigation.md`  |
| Server action result | the `run()` / `ActionResult` shape in `actions.ts`                          |
| HTTP responses       | `{ ok, data }` / `{ ok, error }` — see `api/response-format.md`             |
| Calendar dates       | `fromDateKey` / `toDateKey` — see `development/dates.md`                    |

A second grid or a bespoke dialog is not a local decision; it is a permanent tax on every
future change and a fork in the pattern an agent will learn from. If the shared component
genuinely cannot do the job, extend the shared component.

The same holds inside a file: copy the error-handling, the import order, and the argument
order of the code next to it, even where you would have chosen differently on a blank page.

## Explicit over implicit; simple over general

- Make data flow visible. Prefer a passed argument to a context lookup, a returned value to
  a mutated parameter, one `if` to a lookup table of one entry.
- **No speculative generality.** Do not add an options object, a strategy parameter, or a
  `<T>` for a second caller that does not exist. When the second caller arrives, generalise
  then — the diff is small and the shape will be right, which it would not have been.
- Comments explain _why_, and are worth writing exactly where the reasoning is non-obvious:
  the header comment in `src/lib/fitness/mutations.ts` ("history rows never cascade from the
  outline") is the model. Comments that restate the code are noise that goes stale.
- Where a rule is deliberately not enforced, say so and say why — the
  `no-unnecessary-condition` note in `eslint.config.mjs` is the model. A future agent will
  otherwise "fix" it.

## Testability

Design so the tricky part can be tested without a browser: pure function in, value out.
That is the practical reason logic lives in `src/lib`. What to test and what to skip is
`development/testing.md` — do not duplicate it here.

## DRY, judiciously

Deduplicate a **business rule** — a rule that must change in one place or be wrong. Priority
ordering, shelving semantics, date encoding: one implementation, always.

Tolerate duplicate _shape_. Two components with similar JSX, two queries with a similar
`where`, are not a violation. Extracting them early produces an abstraction with a boolean
parameter, which is worse than the copy and harder to unpick later. Two occurrences is a
coincidence; three with the same reason to change is a pattern.

## When an agent writes it

- **Small, reviewable diffs.** A change that touches one domain folder gets read properly;
  a 40-file change gets skimmed and merged on faith.
- **Review agent output like a junior's:** run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and the
  typecheck, and read the diff. Confident, plausible, and wrong is the failure mode.
- **New abstractions, new dependencies, and new shared components need a reason stated in
  the PR or the spec.** Deleting a guard, a check, or a test to make something pass needs a
  louder one.
- **Load the relevant standards before writing** (`/inject-standards`). Stated constraints
  are what keep generated code inside the guardrails.
- Put human effort into the expensive parts — layer boundaries, the data model, the
  `userId` scoping, domain rules — and let the agent do the mechanical work inside them.
