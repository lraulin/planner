# Security

This file exists because real bank data landed in the app on 2026-08-12. The application
layer already scoped every finance read and write by `userId`; what it did not have was a
written rule for the next agent that touches auth, a mutation, or a header. The
hardening that prompted this file is
`agent-os/specs/2026-08-12-1316-security-hardening-and-standard/`.

## Per-user scoping is the core invariant

Every mutation takes `userId` as its first argument and **proves ownership before
writing**. An `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND user_id = ?` that matches nothing looks exactly
like a successful no-op, so a dropped `userId` is invisible unless something checks.
`requireTransaction` / `requireAccount` in `src/lib/finances/mutations.ts` are the
pattern: load the row scoped to the caller, throw if it is missing, then write.

A database test is not done until a second user has tried to read, change, and delete
the first user's row and failed at every step. That is also in
`development/testing.md`; it is restated here because it is a security rule that happens
to be enforced by tests, not a testing preference.

When you add a query module, register it in
`src/lib/db/crossUserReads.integration.test.ts`. That file is the repo-wide sweep for a
dropped `userId`. A new `listX` that only ever runs in a one-user test will not catch
itself.

## The auth gate is server-side; the proxy is not the gate

`src/proxy.ts` checks cookie _presence_ so guests never see the app chrome. The
authority is `getCurrentUserId()` inside each page and action, which validates the
session. That redundancy is the point. Next's middleware-bypass CVE class
(CVE-2025-29927) was a non-event here because a request that skipped the proxy still
had no session and no user.

Do not "simplify" this by making the proxy the only check. Do not narrow the matcher
to skip prefetches: that matcher is the auth gate as well as the header pass.

## Three identities stay separate

From `src/lib/auth/identity.ts`:

1. **Session user** — a human at `/login`.
2. **Dev user** — who the local bypass serves. Default `test@example.com`. Never an
   owner account by default.
3. **Agent user** — who a valid `PLANNER_AGENT_API_KEY` maps to. Required in
   production; no fallback to a real account.

These were one function until the local bypass started running as the account linked to
a real Google Calendar. Unconfigured defaults must resolve to a test address or throw,
never to real data. The two independent gates on the bypass itself are in
`src/lib/auth/dev-bypass.ts` — it is inert in a production build even if the env var
is set.

## Secrets

- Environment only. `.env*` is gitignored except `.env.example`.
- Fail closed when a required secret is unset. The agent Bearer key is the model:
  missing key → `internal`, not open access. See `api/agent-auth.md`.
- Timing-safe comparison for any shared secret, and hash first so length does not leak.
- Never log an `Authorization` header or a password.

## Errors: messages we wrote are user-facing; messages the database wrote are not

Deliberate throws (`new Error("Transaction not found.")`) are the inline validation the
drawers render. Driver errors are not. `postgres` quotes table, column, and constraint
names, and a constraint violation can quote the offending **row values** — which for
the finance tables is a bank description and an amount. Connection failures embed the
database host.

The tell is a `code` property, or `name === "PostgresError"`. Nothing this codebase
throws on purpose has a `code`. The check lives in `src/lib/security/safeError.ts` and
runs at every client boundary: `actionErrorMessage` in `src/app/actionResult.ts`, and
the import/export route catches. Log the real error before replacing it, or the next
Neon timeout becomes "Something went wrong." with no way to find out why.

Do not start a `UserFacingError` hierarchy to "do this properly." One hundred and fifty
deliberate sentences would have to be reclassified, and a missed one would become
"Something went wrong." The leak class that matters is the one nobody wrote.

## Headers and CSP

Static headers live in `next.config.ts`: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`. The Content-Security-Policy is **not** there —
it carries a per-request nonce, generated in `src/proxy.ts` and built by
`src/lib/security/csp.ts`.

The nonce must be set on the **request** and the **response**. Next.js extracts it by
parsing the CSP off the request, which is how framework and bundle script tags get it
without a single `<script>` being touched. Setting it only on the response ships a
policy whose nonce nothing on the page carries — a blank screen, not a soft failure.

Two constraints that will look like mistakes:

- **No nonce in `style-src`.** A nonce present in a directive makes the browser ignore
  `'unsafe-inline'` in that same directive. FullCalendar positions every event with an
  inline `style` attribute; a nonce here breaks the calendar while looking stricter.
- **`'unsafe-eval'` is development only.** React uses `eval` to rebuild server stacks
  in the browser. Neither React nor Next.js evals in a production build.
  `upgrade-insecure-requests` is production only for the same reason:
  `http://localhost:3047` must keep working.

**Do not set HSTS.** Vercel already sends
`max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` on `.vercel.app`, and that domain is on
the browser preload list. A hand-rolled value would risk overriding a
preload-qualified one with a weaker one.

## Rate limiting

Better Auth's in-memory sign-in limit (3 per 10s) is adequate against a 36-character
password from a manager, with public sign-up disabled. Database-backed storage would
buy DoS/cost control at the price of a table and a write per auth request on Neon's
free tier.

Revisit when any of these become true: a second human user, public sign-up, or a
password that is not from a manager.

`minPasswordLength` is 16 in both `src/lib/auth/server.ts` and
`src/lib/auth/provision.ts`. The provision copy exists because a script that hashed a
short password would write a row Better Auth then refused to sign in.

## Dependencies

Patch `next` promptly — it is the runtime surface. Dev-only transitives
(`drizzle-kit`, `esbuild`, unused `sharp` via `next/image`) are low priority.
Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens the PRs weekly, grouped by
production/development minor+patch. Majors stay ungrouped so they get read.

## Markdown

`rehype-raw` stays out of `react-markdown`. Notes are a stored-XSS surface if HTML in
a note becomes executable. See `src/components/notes/MarkdownPreviewBody.tsx`.
